SATIRE Vll.

RUPlLlUS REX.

A ransom anecdote hom Horace's experiente in the short period that be was
attached to Brutus' fortunes. Brutus, who was ¹ Praetor urbanus' in the year 44,
had been promised by Caesar the province of Macedonia, and atter a struggle with
C. Antonius, who had been actually nominated to it by the Senate, took posses·
sion oi it at the beginning ol rte. 43. Cassius had in a similar way taken posses·
sion oi the province oi Syria. In the course os this year C. Trebonius, another os
the conspiratura, who, having been consul in 45, bad received the proconsular pro-
vince οἱ Asia, was treacherously murdered by Dolabella. This brought both
Brutus and Cassius into Asia.

Brutus is represented as holding a ‘conventus' as though he were ‘ proconsul!

country-brad Roman os Praeneste, with his tliiek skin and heavy·handed sarcasma

end, and ia at any rate one which Horace would have avoided when he had
come to Rome and had renlized that the world was passing to ‘Caesar's avenger.'
