LIB. Ι. EPIST. 3. 233

Quid mihi Celsus agit? monitus multumque monendus 1⁵
Privatas ut quaerat opes, et tangere vitet

Quae circumvolitas agilis thyma? Non tibi parvum
Ingenium, non incultum est et turpiter hirtum.

Seu linguam causis acuis, seu civica iura

Respondete paras, seu condis amabile carmen,

Prima feres hederae victricis praemia. Quodsi ²5
