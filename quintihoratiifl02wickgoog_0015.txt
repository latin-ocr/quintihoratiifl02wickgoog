4 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

clude the lapse of a little time since the question was actually put.
The general conclusion is that when all the doubtful points are
given in favour of the earliest date we cannot place earlier than the
spring of Μ. 38 the occasion described in Sat. 1. 6. 61, when
Maecenas, nine months after Horace’s first introduction to him by
Virgil and Varius, ‘sent for him again and bade him be in the number'
of his friends! The date may possibly be a year or two later.

It is characteristic of Horace’s change of position between Books '
I and 11 that the references to political events and persons, fairly
frequent in the later Book, should be almost wholly absent in the
earlier. His great anxiety in describing his friendship with Maecenas
is to represent it as personal and literary, not political. The fifth
Satire, which describes the journey which Horace took with him
when he was bound on affairs of state to Brundisium, might be ex-
pected to give us just the clue we want: but not a word escapes to
indicate the occasion of the mission, and we are reduced to search·
ing the pages of Dion for notices of movements which may suit it.
It is very doubtful how far their picture of the time is minute or
exact enough to enable us to do this with the hope of certain result:
but of the occasions which have been suggested the only two which
are not excluded by other considerations (see Introd. to Sat. 1. 5)
fall one in the autumn of Μ. 38, the other in the spring of 37,
eithe'r of which will suit the date we obtained from Sat. a. 6.

A literary reference of some importance is in the same direction.
The words used of Virgil, Sat. 1. ro. 44, where Horace is speaking
of the way in which' the main departments of poetry are already
occupied by masters with whom he has no mind to compete, ‘molle
atque facetum Vergilio annuerunt gaudentes rure Camenae,' must
mean that Virgil was already known to the world as the author of
the Eclogues ¹. Considerations drawn from the political references
of Ecl. 10 show that these were not published before Μ. 37.

The earliest date then at which the composition of the larger part
of Sat. I can be placed is the end of Μ. 38. The earliest date
which can be assigned for the completion and publication of the
Book is in or after Μ. 37. Towards settling the latest possible date
the first fixed point is Μ. 33, to which there is reference in Sat.
2. 3.185. If we allowa little time on theone side for Horace's
acquaintance with Maecenas to ripen, and to be the subject of
public talk, and for the composition of the Satires which refer to it,

¹Frsnke would add Georg 1, which 1. 1. 114- 115, but see notes on that
he thinks Horace rs imitating in Set. place.
