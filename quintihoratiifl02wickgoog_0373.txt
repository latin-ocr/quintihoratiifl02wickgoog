368 HORATII EPISTULARUM

Ni melius dormire putem quam scribere versus?

Singula de nobis anni praedantur euntes;

Eripuere iocos, Venerem, convivia, ludum;

Tendunt extorquere poemata; quid faciam vis?

Carmine tu gaudes, hic delectatur iambis,

Ille Bioneis sermonibus et sale nigro.

Tres mihi convivae prope dissentire videntur.

Quid dem? quid non dem? renuis tu, quod iubet alter;
Quod petis, id sane est invisum acidumque duobus.
Praeter cetera me Romaene poemata censes 65
