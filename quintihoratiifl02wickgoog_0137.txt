27-30. l). ‘As others do-the madness only changed its place!

3¹· Horace maliet a light suswer, sod Damasippus goes on more seriously to
luy down the truth that has explained lile to him, and so reconciled him
to it.

31-76. ‘Iwas going to drown myseli sor sharne3 but Stertinius saved me from
that lolly, and bade me becorm a philosopher. by explaining to me that 1 was
oo worse than others-only one more msdmau in amad world. Everybody
is mad bnt the true philosopher. It is only s choice of follies. Some sre
afraid where no iear is-others are not afraid where they should be. Darna·
sippus is mad on buying old statues-Is not the money-lender mad who sup-
plies him with mesos to do iti ¹

gance—superstition.

82-157. Avarice first. Staberius bnde his heirs eugrare on bis tomb the amount
ol the fortune be bad leit. That seemed to him the one solid title to lame.
Thai is a madness which mniches Aristippus. who flung away his money in
the desert. Money is oi velue, but only to use. Avarice is not thought mad·
ness, merely because it is so common. Why do you hoardl For sear you
come to poverty? Your petty economies do not effect the result. On
the other hand il you ean lire on so little, why commit such crimes in order to

ends in murder and suicide.
