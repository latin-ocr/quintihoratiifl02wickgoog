264 HORATII EPtSTULARUM

EPISTLE ΧΙ.

ΤΟ BULLATIUS.

Verses 1-ro. You have been visiting all the famous and beautiful places on the
ooast of Asia. Well,whnt do you think of theml Do you think Rome
beats them all? or have you a hankering for oue of the towns of Attalus-e
old kingdom? or heve you an enthusiasm for even Lebedus aa an alternative
to further travelling on the sea?

rr-ao. But travelling is not the business of life. It is good for those who are
siclt, in mind or body. These who are not do not need it, and should he
content to praise the sights of foreign lands hut spend their lives at home.

21-30. Enjoy what you have. Our modern restlessness does not diminish care.
What we need is a well-balauoed mind.

The occasion is arrisit of Bnllatius to places of interest on the coast of Asia
Minor, places of which Horace speaks with the air of one who has himself seen
thern (see ou Sat. 1. 7). Bullatius is apparently to be thought of as still in the
Euat (see on v. rr), perhaps as having written a letter, to which this isan answer‚
with some traveller’s raptores on the beautiful places he is visiting. The substance
of the Epistle is an indictment of foreign travel as a form of the restlessness of the
nge. The feeling which finds definite expression hereis to he uaced in many
passages of the Odes. It is part of the motive of Od. r. 3-Horaoe wishes Virgil
a happy voyage, but ‘ nou invidet, miratur magis ε’ of Od. r. 7-he agrees with
Plancus that Rhodes and Mytilene do not make up for banishment from Tibur,
even though he preaches for the occasion patience under it: of Od. 2. 6—‘Septi·
mius' friendship would stand the strain of any travel. but may it not be put to auch
astrainl “Sit modus lasso maris et viarum.'' Itismore plainly put in Od. 216.
18 foll, which should he specially compared wlth this Epistle.

Nothing is known of Bullatius. It is possible that he risited the East iu the
train of Tiberius: see introd. to Epp. 1. 3.
