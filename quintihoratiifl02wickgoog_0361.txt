³5⁶ Honnrn srrsrunnuun

Si foret interris, rideret Democritus, seu

Diversum confusa genus panthera camelo,

Sive elephas albus volgi converteret ora;

Spectaret populum ludis attentius ipsis,

Ut sibi praebentem nimio spectacula plura3

Scriptores autem narrare putaret asello

Fabellam surdo. Nam quae pervincere voces 200
Evaluere sonum referunt quem nostra theatra?

Garganum mugire putes nemus aut mare Tuscum,

Tanto cum strepitu ludi spectantur et artes,

Divitiaeque peregrinae, quibus oblitus actor

Cum stetit in scena, concurrit dextera laevae. 205
Dixit adhuc aliquid? Nil sane. Quid placet ergo?

Lana Tarentino violas imitata veneno.

Ac ne forte putes me, quae lacere ipse recusem,

Cum recte tractent alii, laudare maligne3
