GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE
LITERARY EPISTLES.

Tuaen remain three Epistles (ad Augustum, ad Florum, ad
Pisones) which are osten classed together as the three Epistles oi
the Second Book ; an arrangement which derives a prona facie ap-
propriateness from their general lilreness in topics and scale. The
title, however, as applied to the three has no ancient authority.
The MSS. and Scholia agree in placing the first two together in
their present order and calling them the Second Book. The third
Epistle is referred to by Quintilian twice, once as Horace’s ‘Ars
Poetica ¹,' once as the ‘liber de arte poetica ²,' and the former title is
given to it by Terentius Scaurus (Hadrian's reign) as quoted by
Charisius. Charisius himself cites a passage from it as from ‘the
Epistles' In the MSS. and Scholia it is awaif and stray placed
generally aiter the Fourth Boolr os the Odes‚ less frequently alter the
Carmen Seculare, once aster the Epodes. ·

Its present position is due to the editors oi the middle oi the
sixteenth century. Cruquius (1578) is the first who calls it the third
Epistle os Book 2.

It will be convenient, however, without committiug ourselves be·
forehand to any theory of their relation, to put together what has to
be said on the difficult question oi the date and circumstances oi the
three Epistles.

The first two give perhaps some indication os having been placed
together by Horace as companion poems and in their present order,
in the fact that while one is addressed to Augustus, the other, al-
though it is addressed to Florus, carries in its first line a compliment
to Tiberius. This reminds us ol the careiul distribution of honour
between the Emperor and his stepsons in Book 4 of the Odes3
aud the argument is strengthened is, as seems probable, the Epistle
