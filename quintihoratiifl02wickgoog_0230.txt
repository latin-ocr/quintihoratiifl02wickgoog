these is Ritter. The latter by those who think it to be addressed to a boy. (3) As
a cognomen. This is no new theory, having been held by Scaliger, bnt it has
gained general belief since Meinelre’s advocacy os it. There is no trustworthy
evidence oi the cognomen borne by M. Lollius, the consul oi rr. e. 21. Under the
Republic the only cognomen found in the gens Lollia is Palicanus. A grand·
daughter ol his is called ‘Lollia Paullina,' and this has been supposed to indicate
that the cognomen was Paullinus. But the whole question ol cognomina at this
period is very obscure. A ‘Lollius illeximus' is found in an inscription, but ol
a much later date. Keller compares Ovid's address (ex Pont. s. 8. a aud 3. 5. 6)
‘Maxime Cotta' to the son oi Messalla, the orator, who had been adopted into the
Aurelia gens, and bore apparently both the cognomen which belonged to it, and
that of Maximus, an old cognomen in the Valeria gens, to which by birth he be-
longed.
