SATIRE VllL

cantolu.

Tttts first, probably, ol ’Horace's attacks on Canidia. See Epod. 5, and especially
the introductions to Epod. 17 and od. 1. 16, and compare Epod. 3. 8; sat. 1.1.48,
2. 8. 95.

‘Ihe Scholiasta (on Epod. 3.8 and on 1. 24 oi this Satire) say that under the
name oi Canidia was satiriued one Gratidia ‘unguentaria Neapolitana! With this
exception we have no external assistance ln reading the riddle oi the poems them-
selves. We are to imagine a woman whose fascination Horace has ielt though he
resents it. and which he attributes with more or less oi irony to magle. The ludicrous
catastrophe oi the Satire as well as the moclr heroic air which flavours the narrative
seem to iorbid usto take it quite seriously ; cp. in this respect Od. 1. 16 introd.

The scene ot' the Satire is the Campus quuilinus, the plateau irom which the
several arms oi the Esquiline hill are thrust out. It was without the ‘agger’ ot
Servius Tullius and had been used ‘ as an extensive burial place ior the lowest class
oi people, andaplace oi execution ior criminals? Cp„ besides this Satin, Epod. 5.
99. Sat. 1. 6. 53, Bum's Rome and the Campagna‚ p. 225. Maecenas had
recently become possessor oi it and had laid it out in pleasure gardens. He even·
tually built a residence there (Od. 3. ²9· 10, Epod. 9. 3). The Satire thus becomes
the vehicle oia compiiment to one who is already Horace’s patron. The speaker
throughout is Priapus, a rough wooden image oi the garden god (Virg. G. 4. 110)

which has been erected in the new gardeu. The transformation oi the ground is
barely complete. There are still ‘magna sepulchra,' and bones to be found by
scratching the ground. It is still haunted apparently by witches. With the
witchcrait oi this Sat. cp„ besides Epod.5 and 17, Theoc.1dyll a, Virg. Ecl. 8,
