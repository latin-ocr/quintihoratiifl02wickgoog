60 HORATII SATIRARUM

SATIRE V.

THE JOURNEY TO BRUNDISIUM.

Tira idea of the Satire was from Lucilius. ‘Lucilium hac satira aemulatus
Horatius iter suum a Roma usque ad Brundisium describens quod et ille in tertio
libro fecit, primum a Roma Capuam usque et inde fretum siciliense· A few frag·
ments of the model exist: for one effect of its iufluence see note cn p. 6.

A chief purpose doubtless of the Satire is ιο gire a picture of thepoet's relatiom
ιο Maecenas, the freedom and absence of servility which chmcteriae them; the
literary circle with which they were shared, the absence, even at a criticd moment
in state affairs, of any political bearing in the intimacy.

So strongly isthic last characteristic reflected in the poem that it laelss any
reference to public events by which we might have iixed the occasion aud date of
the joumey.

The only occasion on which we lrnow of an arrangement having been concluded
at Brundisium between Octavianus and Autony was the socalled peace of Brundi·
sium in rae. 40 (the occasion of Virgil's 4th Belogue), when Maecenas represented
Octavianus, Pollio Antony, and Cocceius was added as a referee (κοινὸς ἀμφοῖν
Appian, Bell. Civ. 5. 709). This is excluded by the conditions of the case, as
Horace was certainly not admitted to Maecenas’ circle before rae. 383 see lutrod.
to Satires, pp. 3, 4. It is however alluded to in v. 29, where Maecenas and Cocceius
are called ‘legati aversos soliti componere amicos’ Kimmer (followed by
Fraulre, Orelli, and Ritter) maintained that the journey belongs to the ‘heaty cf
Tarentum' ia ιιε spring of nc. 37. Antony came on that occasion to Brundisium,
as though that were the place appointed for meeting‚ but being ill-received hythe
inhabitants went on to Tarentum, where eventually terms were arranged through

2 the intervention of Octavia, who called in the help of Maecenas and Agrippa aa

friends of Octavianus (Plut. Ant. 35). There is no further evidence as to any
Journey of negotiators on behalf of Octavianus ιο Brundisium, aad if they also went
on to Tarentum it is not explained why Horace stops the story where he does.
Schutz has lately suggested, with great probability, that the reference is to the pre·
vicus mission of Maecenas to Antony, then probably at Atheus, in the autumn of
38 (Appian, BC. 5. 728). Horace would then have accompanied him to the place
of embarcation. lt is natural that Maecenas should associatewith himself for such
apurpose Capito, who was a personal friend of Antony, and Cocceius, who had
been previously employed by both sides as an impartial adviser. Cocceius is
probably the M. Cocceius Nerva who was consul in Β. c. 36, the great-grandfatherof
the Emperor Nerva. L. Fonteius Capito was ‘consul suffectus’ in ne 30. We
lind him immediately after the ‘treaty of Tarentum' in Antony's company, and
employed by him tc bring Cleopatra to Syria.

1-6. Horace starts with Heliodorus and trauels along the Via Appia, ιιο first day to
Aricia, the second to Appii Forum, reaching it in the evening.

7-26. The jcurney is continued through the night by boat along ιιε anal [which
had been part of a scheme of Octavianus for draining the Pomptine marshes
(see A. P. 65)]. They land late in the morning, and have three miles to climb
to Anxur on its clins.

27-33. Here ibe negotiatura join them, coming possibly by sea.
