LIB. ΙΙ. EPIST. 2.

Obturem patulas impune legentibus aures.

Ridentur mala qui componunt carmina; verum

Gaudent scribentes et se venerantur, et ultro,

Si taceas laudant quicquid scripsere beati.

At qui legitimum cupiet fecisse poema,

Curn tabulis animum censoris sumet honesti; 110
Audebit, quaecunque parum splendoris habebunt

Et sine pondere erunt et honore indigna feruntur,

Verba movere loco, quamvis invita recedant

Et versentur adhuc† intra penetralia Vestae.
