qualifies it,—‘ Bioneis sermonibus et sale nigro? On the other haud
in Epp. 2. 1. 250 ‘sermones . . . repentes per humum' seems meant ’
to cover the Epistles as well ¹.

The term had in the first place a selidepreciatory meaning, and is
explained by the words in Sat. 1. 4. 39-48, where he declines the
name of ‘poemata' sor his writings, and designates them as‘sennoni
propiora' comparing them iu this respect to Comedy, which is, ‘nisi
quod pede certo Differt sermoni, sermo merus! They were poems, ·
if poems at all, on the level os common conversation. But it was
a deliberate substitution not only for ‘poemata' but also for the
natural name, which he had at first given, oi ‘Sasima' lt was meant
to describe the poems as Horace wished them to be regarded, and if
‘sermo’ be taken in its common sense os ‘talk' it describes them
very well ¹. Whatever else they are, they are imitations of conversa· l
tion—‘talks,‘ ‘causerr'es'-imitations of the best talk of a polished
time—in its ease, its diversity os topic, its gracesul transitions, its ,
spice oi personality‚ its play oi repartee, its irony, its anecdotes, (ables, ,-
quotations, allusions³. But the talk had a definite scope. It was
such talk as Horace indicates in Sat. a. 6. 71 f, on subjects of the
highest interest, even if treated with a light hand. lt was talk on tlte-
artof living. Even literature has an incidental rather than a primary
place in it. He has to make his ‘apologia' both for venturing to
follow Lucilius and sor venturing to difier from him ; and this raises the
question, which will occupy so much of his later writings, os the taste
oi the day in its unqualified preference oi the older writers to the new
classical school to which he attaches himself. He is also at first the
conscious ‘freedman's son,’ the mark of envious tongues, and he has
to iustify his right to ‘open his mouth ' as though his ancestors as well
