SATIRE VIII.

nu unsrnnr's surpra-nsaw.

A sxurcri of a supper given to Maecenas by a man of wealth without taste
or breeding. Horace puts the description ol it into the mouth of Fundanius,
the cornic poet, os whom he speaks with admiration in Sat. 1. 10. 40: bnt it
represents, no doubt, many entertainments at which he had himself suffered and
been amused.

Three men ol letters have been invited as appropriate guests to meet Maecenas,
Fundanius himself, Viscus (see on v. πο), aad Varius. The rest oi the company
eonshts ol the chief guest with two ‘umbrae' (vv. 21, υ) whom be has brought,
and two ‘scurrae,’ ‘Nomentanus' and ‘Porcina’ who are habitual frequentem
of the host's table.

The host is called Nasidienus Rufus (rw. 1, 75, 84, and 58)—doubtless a
fictitions name. Α conjecture oi Lambinus identifies the person so disguised
with Salvidienus Rufus, who had been advanced by Augustus ‘ex infima
fortuna’ (Suet. Aug. 66), and who was put to death by him ior conspiracy
against his interests in nc. 4ο. In that ease the Satire would be written some
years atter his death. Nasidienus was itseli a Roman name and occurs in Martial
7· ⁵4·

What is satirined is the vulgarity oi the man. He has literary men to meet
Maecenas, but he ean talk oi nothing but the dishes. He Is full oi the gas·
