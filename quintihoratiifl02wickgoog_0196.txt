Contudit articulos, qui pro se tolleret atque

Mitteret in phimum talos, mercede diurna

Qui iam content0, iam laxo fune laborat.' 20

Fortunam et mores antiquae plebia, et idem

Si quis ad illa deus subito te agat usque recuses,

Aut quia non sentis quod clamas rectius esse,

Aut quia non firmus rectum defendis, et haeres
Nequicquam caeno cupiens evellere plantam.
