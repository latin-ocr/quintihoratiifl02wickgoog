EPISTLE VII.

TO MAECENAS.

Verses 1-9. Iranxsn ofa few days in the country, Maecenas, and it has proved
to mean all August. But as you would excuse me if 1 were ill, so you must
excuse me for shunning what makes me ill.

10-13. Rome in autumn is deadly ; and if the winter is cold, Imust go to the
sea-cosst3 so you must not look for me till the spring.

14-19. Your generosity to me has not been that of the Calabrian host who presses
on his guest pears that are so plentiful that what he refuses goes to the pigs

20-24. True generosity ehooses worthy objects, but gives what it values. 1 hope
I sm not unworthy of your bonnty.

²548. What faiis me is youthful benith and vigour, and that you cannot restore
to me.

29-34. If any one says ‘ you have surrendered your liberty, and can only regnin
itin the saure wey as the visen who got into the corn-bin when she had an
empty stomach,' I take him at his worri.

35, 36. 1 quite mean what I say, and really prefer liberty to wealth.

37-43. It is not that 1 arn discoutented or ungrateful; but you would see that
I could ebeerfuily return ali you gave me, and answer as Telemachus
answered when horses which he could never use were offered to him.

44, 45. What 1 want now is not the grandeur of Rome but the leisure and peace
os the country.

4b98. The story of Philippus and Volteius isn warning to the givers and receivers
of patronage. The latter should be wise in time aud draw back as soon as
they find that the offered improvement of their position is no improve-
ment. The measure which suits one man will not suit another.

The Epistle is a picture of potronage as r't shoujd bc and as it should not be.
lt is implied in the idea of such a poem as well as asserted in words iu it, thar
Mseceuas’ patronage has been of the former kind—such ns was honouroble both to i
patron und to poet. The Epistie, therefore, rnnges itself with Sat. r. 5, 6, and
9, which describe aud defend Horace’s relation to Maecenas. '
