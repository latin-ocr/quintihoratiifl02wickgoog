Nostros et tenui deducta poemata filo,

Cum speramus eo rem venturam ut, simul atque
Carmina rescieris nos fingere, commodus ultro
Arcessas et egere vetes et scribere cogas.

Sed tamen est operae pretium cognoscere, quales
Aedituos habeat belli spectata domique

Virtus, indigno non committenda poetae.

Gratus Alexandro regi magno fuit ille

Choerilus, incultis qui versibus et male natis
Rettulit acceptos, regale nomisma, Philippos.
Sed veluti tractata notam labemque remittunt
Atramenta, fere scriptores carmine foedo
Splendida sacta linunt. Idem rex ille poema
Qui tam ridiculum tam care prodigus emit,
Edicto vetuit ne quis se praeter Apellen
Pingeret, aut alius Lysippo duceret aera
