LIBER PRIMUS.

EPISTLE 1.

TO MAECENAS.

'lire Epistle is written forits place. It is the dedication to Maecenas of the
First Book of the Epistles‚ and it is sn spology (1) for his change of style-from
the Odes to the Epistles3 (a) for the subject-matter of his new compositions. He
has outgrown the power aud inste for lyric poetry. His soul is set now on attain-
ing a philosophy of life. He has not done so ς but short of that, he would mske
the most of such eclectic and elementary fragments of truth as he has made his
own. It is his own mind and life thnt he professes to be thinking of; bnt it is
implied that his compositione will reflect his new tastes.

Verses 1-6. Yon have every claim on me, Maecenas, and I have always ackuow·

of life by attaining a true philosophical scheme.

submit to treatment.

wisdom. If only men were as eager to escape wrong desires as they are to
escape povertyi

49·31. On all snalogy they should be so; for the price offered is greater. the
effort required less, for virtue is to gold as gold is to silver.

52-56. Unfortnnately the opposite doctrine is preached by the business world of
Rome aud learnt eagerly by all classes.

57-64. The arrangements of social rank go the same way. Your place depende
on your money. How much better our boys could teuch ns with their
nurscry jingle ‘ Rex crissi recte facies! That is sounder thau the law of Otho.

68, 69. Which is the better adviser, one who says, ‘Make money without regsrd to
the means‚’ or one who says (aud teaches yon how to do it), ‘Stand up lilre
