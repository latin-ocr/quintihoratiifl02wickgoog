LIB. 1. SAT. 4„

At tu conclusas hircinis follibus auras,

Usque laborantes dum serrum molliat ignis,

Ut mavis imitare Beatus Fannius ultro

Delatis capsis et imagine ; cum mea nemo

Scripta legat vulgo recitare timentis ob hanc rem,

Quod sunt quos genus hoc minime iuvat, utpote plures
Culpari dignos. Quemvis media elige turba: ²5
Aut ob avaritiam aut misera ambitione laborat.

Hic nuptarum insanit amoribus, hic puerorum;

Hunc capit argenti splend0r; stupet Albius aere;
