PREFACE. vii

of Dtintzer (Brunswick, 1849). Kiessling's edition

came into my hands too late to be of sull use. But
Ι have felt again, as Ι said before, that the editor
to whom the student of Horace is most indebted is
Bentley; and Ι have felt more than before (though he
only speaks to us through his text and short prelace
and a few papers in the Journal of Philology) how
strong and trustworthy is the judgment‚ whether in
purely textual questions or in the questions os inter·
pretation which cannot be severed srom text, of the
most Bentleian of English scholars who have touched
Horace, the lamented H. A. J. Munro

May Ι make two requests os the younger readers
whose needs Ι have had specially in view—one, that
they will read, both besore beginning a Satire or
Epistle, and also side by side with it, the analysis
which Ι have prefixed to it and without which the
commentary will be incomplete; the other, that they
will not be deluded, by what has seemed the unhappy
necessity of employing inverted commas for the
double purpose, into mistaking interpretative para-
phrase sor translation? The latter Ι have attempted
rarely; the former is osten a convenient and necessary
substitute for a long note.

Wamrworou Comma, Oct. 1890.

Nota-I must apologize here for a misunderstanding which has led to
some uncorrected variation in spelling. To harmonize with the rest of the
text ‘cum' should be read in Sat. 1. 1. 86, 104, ‘ baca’ in Sat. 2. 4. 693
‘aspectu' ‘aspicere ’ in Sat. 1. 8. 26, 2. 5. 5, 2. 6. 603 ‘temptatum’ in Sat. 1.
1. 803 ‘ obiciebat' in Sat. 1. 4. 123; and ‘o’ should be substituted for ‘u’
in ‘evulsos’ ‘vultis' &a in Sat. 1. 1. 58, 1. 2. 38 and several other places.
