MSS. (see above, p. 327). The Odes always stand before the Epodes;
the Epistles in many MSS. before the Satires. These inversions of
the chronological order are traced with great probability to the large
use of Horace’s writings (a use which dates as early as Juvenal, see
Sat. 7. 227) for the purpose of school teaching. The Odes and the
Ars Poetica are, for different reasons, the compositions which would
be thought most serviceable. The only substantial contribution to
the question of date made by the Scholiasts is in Porphyrion's state-
ment (of which there is no sign that he perceived the chronological
import) that the ‘Piso, pater' of the poem is ‘L. Piso custos, id est,
praefectus urbis, nam et ipse Piso poeta fuit et studiorum liberalium
antistes! This is the man who was consul in ne. 15, and whose
death Tacitus records in Ann. 6.10. He died in ab. 31 at the
age of 80. He was born therefore in the year ac. 49. This will
allow of his having had two sons growing up to manhood (‘ iuvenes ’)
and capable of literary ambitions within the limits of Horace’s life,
but it would drive us to the last years of it, ac. 10-8. These, there·
fore, who argue for an earlier date have to give up this Piso and fall
back generally on the suggestion of Cn. Piso, who was consul in ac.
a 3. He had been an adherent of Brutus, which gives him a link to
Horace. He had a son also named Gnaeus, who was consul in nc.
7, and who would be the ‘maior iuvenum' of this poem.

When the Ars Poetica was transferred by Η. Stephanus and
Lambinus to its present place at the end of Horace's works it seems
to have been taken for granted that this was its true chronological
position. Bentley so places it with very slight discussion. This
view has been maintained in this century by Kirchner, Ritter,
Dillenburger and Orelli. Franke, on the other hand, lcans to the
earlier date, and this is the one which has been in most favour with
recent critics. The arguments for it have been most fully stated by
A. Michaelis ¹ and more recently by Prof. Nettleship². Porphyrion's
identification of Piso evidently does not settle the question, the
Scholiasts being frequently wrong in such cases (see above, p. 9).
We are thrown back on internal evidence. This is of three kinds.

The strongest case for the earlier date is the mention of Maecius
(v. 389) as the critic to whom, in addition to Horace and his own
father, the young Piso is to submit his future poem. If this is the
