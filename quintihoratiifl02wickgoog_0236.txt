The Epistle is addressed to Julius Florus, to whom Horace addresses also the
second Epistle oi Book ΙΙ. See introd. to that Epistle.

Florus is probably identified with the Florus who is named hythe elder Seneca
(Controv. 4. 25) as a pupil iu oratory of M. Porcius Latro, a famous ‘rhetor’ of
Augustus’ time and by Quintilian 10. 3. 14 as ‘ in eloquentia Galliarum, quoniam
ibi demum eam exercuit, princeps ' (cp. u. 2301' this Epistle). The Scholiasta
say ‘Hic Floms t'uit Satirarum scriptor, euius sunt electae ex Ennio Lucilio

uses the word ‘electa' in this sense Epp. 8. rr) from these older poets, perhaps
modemized (see introd. to Sat. 1. ro).
