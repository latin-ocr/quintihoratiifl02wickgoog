ol Horace in giving them sor the first time a clear and
trustworthy conspectus of the evidence of value which
is at our command. But it has not produced a general
agreement, either with their method of grouping the
MSS. in classes or familieS, or with their particular ’
estimate os the value of Cruquius' Old Blandinian

MS. (V) ¹. Cruquius no doubt overestimated its '

antiquity; but, on the other hand, the more the question
has been silted the less reason there has appeared
to be for doubting the care and bona fides of his
testimony, and the more reason sor assenting to the
general judgment of scholars from Bentley downwards,
that we have access in its readings to a text, not
necessarily always right, but of unique value as
exhibiting a tradition independent oi the other MSS.
In addition to the Editors whose help Ι have
acknowledged before, Ι have ol course leant greatly
in the Satires on Heindorf (re-edited by Wtisteman,
Leipzig, 1843) andin the First Book ol the Epistles on
Obbar (Leipzig, 1837). Ι have made great use of the
thoughtsul and independent commentary ol Sch'utz

(Berlin, 1883), and have derived many suggestions srom
the edition of the Satires by Pros. A. Palmer and that
of the Epistles by Proi. Wilkins (Macmillan, 1884 and

1885). Ι have come also to estimate very highly the

compressed but singularly complete and sensible notes

¹ 1 would refer especially to the examination of Kellefs conclusione by
P. Hoehn (‘ de codice Bland. antiquissimo,’Jena, 1883) and W. Mewes
(the editor os the reissue of Orelli, ‘Ueber den wert des Cod. Bland.
vetustissimus,' Berlin, 1882); also to Professor Nettleship, ‘Essays in
Latin Literature‚' p. 188 f.
