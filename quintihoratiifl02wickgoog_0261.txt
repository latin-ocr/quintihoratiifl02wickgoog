256 HORATII EPISTULARUM

EPISTLE VIII.

TO CELSUS ALBINOVANUS.

‘Gruter Celsus lor me, my Musa, the sriend and secretary ol Tiberius. Is he
asks aster me, say that 1 am in my old way-with more intentious than perform-
ances‚ well enough in estate and body, not so well in soul; unwilling to leam, or
take advice, unable to profit by experienoe or lreep a purpose. Aslr him how he
is, how he stands in favour with prince and stuli. If he says “well'’ first wish
him joy, and then in his private ear whisper that he must not let his head be
turned by his fortune!

We oan hardly be wrong in thinking the last verse the gist os the Epistle.
Horace's hali ironical confessions lead up to it. ‘You may say worse os me than
1 wish to suggest ol you. 1 do not listen to my friends3 so Ι cannot complain ii
you do not listen to me’ We may compare the art with which a more temler
reproof is conveyed to Virgil in Odes 1. ²4 (see introd.).

Weichert (poetae Latini, p. 382) would distinguish the 'Celsus Albinovanus’
oi this Epistle from the ‘Celsus‘ ol 1. 3.15f.; but he is driven to do so by his
view that those lines are meant harshly and contemptuously. In desault oi prool

they have too many points in common to be separated
