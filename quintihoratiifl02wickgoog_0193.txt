188 HORATII SATIRARUM

SATIRE Vll.

DAVUS, OR FREEDOM AND SLAVERY.

A nrnuooun during the Saturnalia between Horace aud his slave Davus.

Verses 1-5. D. ¹1t1 could only have my turn at iuuit linding.’
ΙΙ. ‘ Is that Davns' i·
D. ‘Yes, Davus, not a bad bargain to his master, ior all his nulus!
H. ‘Well, use thu lzoence ol the Saturnalia, and say your say?

6-20. Davus starts off in the style iu which Horace represents a Stoic lecturer as
declaiming, with stcolr instances to illustrate his picture oi lile.

‘ Mankind is divided into those who are consistent in their vices, and those
who hover between vice and virtue.

‘Priscus was an instance oi the last, Volanerius of the first, and his lise was
the less miserable of the two!

²1-45· Horace interrupts. ‘What a long preambie, what does it all refer to’l

D. ‘To you!

Il. ‘ How, villain’l

l). ‘Yon praise moderatiori bnt don’t practise it. Yon praise the country
when you are in town -the town when you are in the country. If you are not
asked out to dinner, itlsall ‘ ‘a dinner os herbs.'’ Ii an invitation comes rather
late you are in a iuss and sury to he gone. The poor parasite who meant to
sup with you goes away disappointed, but hc sees through yon, and is more
honest thau you are. Nay, l, your slave, am more osa philosopher than you.
Don’t lrown at rne; li ten to the lessons which 1 picked up lrom the porter at
Crispinus' lecture-mom.¹

46-71. Durus then begins again with a course declamatory compurison, evidently
(lrom vv. 53, 54 ‘proiectis insignibus, annulo equestri. ..prodis ex indice
Dama ’) not addressed personully to Horace, between the vices oi slavos and
those of their masters, to the disadvantage os the latter, as worse and leading
to a more hopeless slavery.

72-94. He supposes Horace to protest: ‘non sum moechus’; but bmshes the
excuse aside with the stoic doctrine that abstinence lrom vioe from secondnry
morives is no true abstinence. (Cp. Epp. 1⁴16. 46 l.) ‘Yon are a slave whom
no manumission can lree. 1 am at most your deputy slave or your lellow
slave. No one is free, but ibe wlse man, who is muster ol himself. That is
not the position osone who is at the beclr and call oi a mistress.

95-101. ‘So you share your slave’s other iuults. He loiters to loolr at pictores
(aster his degree), so do you: though they call you a man ol taste lor it,
while they call him a lary lellow.

102-111. ‘He likes a smolring cake; your virtue is not procl against a good
supper. ii he gets a ibrushing, you get u fit ol indigestion. It isus bad to
sell your estates to seed your gluttony, as ior a slave to exchangc his master’s
“ strigil’' lor a bunch ol grupen [Davus is getting away from Horace again]
