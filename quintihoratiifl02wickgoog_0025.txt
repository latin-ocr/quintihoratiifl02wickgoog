14 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

traces of it in the nomenclature of the odes-Phidyle, Lalage, Lyce,
Bibuli Consulis, etc, see App. I. of vok I. But it is not done
wholesale nor on any apparent system. One of the most evident
instances, ‘Pantolabus scurra’(1.8. 11, 2. 1. 22), is very probably,
like Nomentanus, a stock name of satire, not Horace's own. Of
others, the most certain are Opimius (2. 3. 142), Porcius (2.
8. 23), Novius the upstart (1. 6. 40). The Scholiasts assert that
Maltinus in 1. 2. 25 was coined from ‘malta' a word in Lucilius
for an effeminate person. Some colour is given by the verses which
follow to the connection of Balbinus in 1. 3. 40 with ‘balbutire’
The name Canidia in 1. 8, besides being as the Scholiasts say a
substitution for Gratidia, may have been itself suggested by ‘canus'
and if so, Sagana by ‘saga' though the quantity of the a is different.
Other instances have been found in Cupiennius, 1. 2. 36, as from
‘cupere'3 Avidienus, 2. 2. 56, from ‘avidus' (although here also
there is the difference of quantity, and the person described was
‘avarus' rather than ‘avidus '); Pantilius, 1. 10. 58, from πᾶν τίλλειν ;
Scetanus (a v. l. for Scetanus in 1. 4. 112) from ‘sectari '3 Voranus,
1. 8. 39, from ‘vorare' Even when such doubtful instances are
included the whole number is a small percentage ol Horace’s names.
In several of the cases the other names used in the same connection
have no such colour.

It is not perhaps irrelevant to notice that in the Satires as in
the Odes if names are kept occasionally to a given character as
Maenius and Nomentanus, some on the other hand are used ina
subsequent Satire with no relation to their use in an earlier one.
So Albucius 2. 1.48 and 2. 2. 67, Barms 1. 6. 30 and 1. 7. 8, Cervius
2. 1. 47 and 2. 6. 77, Naevius 1. 1. 101 and 2. 2. 68, Novius 1. 3.
21, 1. 6. 40 and 121. We may add Scaeva in Sat. 2. 1. 53 and Epp.

The number and nature of the poems to be arranged do not
admit of as much thought or variation in their arrangement as
appears in that of the Odes, but the principles at the bottom of the
arrangement are the same. (ι) It is not chronological. Sat. 1. 1, as
we have seen, is subsequent to Sat. 2, 11 it be not, as many think,
the last written in the Book3 1. y is perhaps the earliest os all.
Sat. 2. r again has indications of the latest date to be found in the
Book to which it belongs. (2) Each Book has its Satires written or
