6 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

lex¹ ') to be paralleled only in some of the earlier Epodes. There is
more appearance of those liberties taken with persons of position (not
merely the thieves, moneylenders, misem, and parasites os later
Satires) and oi broad references to real scandale, which he professes
to defend in Sat. 1. 4 and 2. 1, but with apologies which, ii we look
at any Satire but this one, seem to outrun the needs oi the case ¹.
There is above all the curious tradition ol the Scholiasts that under
the name oi Maltinus (or Malchinus) he was satirizing in v. 2 5 the
personal habit oi Maecenas. Ii thisbe true it is so completely un-
like Horace’s bearing towards his friends in high position that it
must mean that the Satire was written besore his acquaintance with
Maecenas commenced, and preserved with Maecenas’ assent is not
at his desire.

ξ 5. Tr'tle and llkrture of the Satr‘res.

Horace uses two words to designate his Satires. .

1. The only title which he uses within athe Satires themselves is
Satira. This he employs in Sat. 2. 1. 1 in the singular, to describe
the form of composition or its spirit, ¹ Sunt quibus in satira videar nimis
acer! He is there speaking of himself as the successor of Lucilius, and
the word has our modern sense os‘ Satire,' the censorious criticism os
life and manners os which Lucilius had set the type. In Sat. 2. 6. 17
he employs the plural oi ‘the separate poems: ‘Quid prius illustrem
satirisi' and it may be noticed that there he has in view another
aspect of satire, familiar also to Lucilius (as he points out in Sat.
2. 1. 30-36)‚ but descending to him lrom the older ‘Satura’ or
medley, oi Satire namely as a vehicle sor autobiographical details
and the expression os personal likes as well as dislikes

2. But it is noticeable that in the Epistles, when he looks back at
the Satires and ranks thern with his other kinds oi composition
he drops entirely the term ‘satirae' His classification is ‘lambi'
‘Carmina' ‘Sermones' In Epp. 1. 4. 1 the first place where he uses

this term-‘sermonum nostrorum candide ludenti-he is probably
speaking of the Satires only3 and so too in Epp. 2. 2. 60, where he
