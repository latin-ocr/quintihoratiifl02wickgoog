arn. 11. sar. 7. 189

ιιι-115. ‘Nay, yon are a runaway, for you are always trying to escape yourself
and give the slip to care; but you are caught again, as a slave might be.'

116-118. This last sally is supposed to exhaust Horace’s patience, and after one
more thrnst Davus is driven away by the threat that he shall be sent to the
Sabine farm.

lt is a companion Satire to the third of this Book. The substantial part of both
is in the playful use of a Stoic paradox as a text for a discourse on the follies of
men. ln both Horace turns the laugh against himself, Damasippus there, Davns
here, charging him with his own faults and especially with the two, laziness (Sat. 3)
and changeableness (Sat. 7), to which he professes to plead guilty in Epp. 1. 8. ro-
12. ln the third Satire the thesis taken is the one dealt with in Cicero’s Parador, 4
ὅτι πᾶς ἄφρων μαίνεται, in this one Cicero’s Paradox, 5 ὅτι μόνος d σοφὸς ἐλεύθερος
καὶ πᾶς ἄφρων δοῦλος. There are signs in both that Horace was familiar with
Cicero's expositione of the text. The setting in each ease is dramatie, the para-
dox being pressed on Horace in Sat. 3 hythe bankrupt virtuoso, who has himself
been saved from suicide by discovering that he was no more mad than most men
—in this Satirc being put into the concrete form of a slave’s claim, urged with the
freedom of a licensed moment, to be as good as his master. In neither Satire is
the dramatic purpose kept perfectly; when the Stoic teaching is reached the style
becomes declamatory and imitativa of the lecturer, and the particular occasion is
for the moment forgotten. ¹

The Bland. MSS. had this Satire (as have some good extant MSS.) written
continnously with the preceding one-evidentlyamistake; but it bears witness to a
true instinct of the close relation between this Satire and its predecessore. Bentley
explains ‘iamdudum ansculto’ in v. r of Davus having heard Horace declaim Sat. 6,
and feeling stirred toanswer it This is probably put too narrowly 3 but the position
of the Satire in relation to Sat. 6, when compared with that of Sat. 3 to Sat. a, and
its position in relation to the Book in view of its manifest reference to both the
directly didactic Satires (cp. vv. aa, ²3 with Sat. a. a. 89-93, as well as v. 28 with
Sat. 6) make it clear that one purpose is to lighten with his habitnal irony any
tone of assumption that might be felt in the preceding Satires. ‘Who am 1
to lecture others? They may very well return it in kind!

It should be noticed that it is irony, though the irony be a veil of real modesty.
Not to speak of the graver charges which he seems to countenance against himself,
his love for the country which he appears here, for fear of having spoken too en-
thusiastically about it in Sat. 6, to nndervalue asa mere phase of feeling, was deep
and true; see Epp. 1. ro. r and 14. He contrasts his own constancy in respect of
it with his bailiff's changeableness. Epp. 1. 14. 14-26.
