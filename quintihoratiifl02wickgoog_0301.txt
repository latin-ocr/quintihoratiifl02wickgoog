. NOTE ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SITE OF HORACE’S
‘VILLA¹.'

Tun ‘Sabine valley' in which Horace's estate lay can be certainly
identified, though the exact spot on which his house stood is still
doubtful.

Seven miles above Tivoli in the Anio valley‚ on the road to Subiaco
(ie. on the ancient ‘via Valeria,' afew miles before the point at which
the ‘via Sublacensis ’ diverged from it), stands the little town of Vico
Varo, the Varia of Epp. 1. 14. 3. Here there opens from the left a
side valley, running directly from north to south. In this valley‚ near
its junction with that of the Anio and beyond the stream, is seen at
some height the village of Cantalupo·Bardella, or, as it is called in
the Italian staff Map, Mandela, for it has been conclusively identified
with Horaee’s Mandela ‘rugosus frigore pagus' (Epp. r. 18. 104).
The valley is that of the Digentia (Epp. 1. 18. 104), a name which
ι survives in the form of Licenza, and is given both to a village which
did not exist in Horace's day, or his ‘vilicus' would have found the
tavern life which he so much missed (Epp. 1. 14. 24), and to the
stream in its lower course: higher up it is known as the Maricella.
At Vico Varo a road turns off up the Licenza valley‚ keeping at
some height on the western side, and in three miles reaches the
little village of Rocca Giovane. lt was here that a few years ago
an inscription was found recording the restoration by Vespasian of
a temple of Victory. This is held with great probability to have
been the ‘fanum putre Vacunae’ of Epp. 1. 10. 49. Vespasian was of
Sabine origin, having been born at Reate, and it is natural that he
should have restored the temples of Sabine denies, and especially
