greater or less,' eto, as though ‘ve’ could be used in alternative interrogation,¹
bnt ‘are they either greater or lessl'. i. e. ‘are they just what the world says, or
either greater or (“ ve ”) Iessl' (a) Keller with the sarne punctuation understands
a repeated 'Quid'r ‘what ol Smyrna aud Colophon? [what] oi towns greater
or less in reputel' ‘tama' being in this rendering an abl. not of comparison but
ol the ‘part concerned.' (3) Orelli and Dillr. remove the stop at ‘tama’ con·
uecting the words ‘maiora,' etc. with the following line: 'Be they greater or less
than their repute, do all slike pale before the Campus and Tiber streaml' ln
this interpretation also ‘ isma' may be taken for ‘ in repute,' instead ol ¹ than their
repnte? (4) Schiitz removes the question at ‘Colophon’ retains it at ‘ samal’
The words ‘maiora . . . tama' then become the qualification grammatically ol
‘Smyrna et Colophon,’ answering to the more special epithets which have been
given to Chios and Lesbos, Samos and Sardis ‘What oi Smyrna and Colophon,
greater places or (it may be) smaller thau the world thinks theml' This is the

EPISTLE XII.

TO ICCIUS.

Tttts Epistle brings together the Iccius ol Od. 1. ²9 and the Pompeius
Grosphus ol Od. a. 16. The purpose is in the first instance personal-to intro·
duce Grosphus to Iccius. who is acting aa ‘procurator' in charge ol Agrippa‘s
Sicilian estates. It is to be noticed that Grosphus seems when the Ode (see
vv. 33-37) was written to have been a wealthy proprietor in Sicily. Ile is now
returning to the island, and is in a positi0u, we know not how, in which Iccius
may be able to help him.

The Epistle also implies that Iccius has complained (either in a letter to
Horace or otherwise) that he is managing the estate of another rather than an
Independent property ol his own. The poet rallies him gently ior this (vv. 1-16),
turning his remonstrauee into compliments on the simple lise which no increase
oi wealth would effect (vv. 7-11), and the maiutenance ol high philosophieal
iuterests in a post where there was so much to foster a greed ol gain (vv. imo).
From this he passes lightly (v. ιι) to the introduction and commendation os
Grosphus (vv. 22-24). The Epistle ends with some lines (vv. ²5-29)› ol which
the prolessed purpose is to give the news from Rome, but which, il we suppose
such un Epistle to be written tor a largcr circle ot' readers, associate with it the
names, in a climax, ot' Agrippa, Tiberius, Augustus, and liood the picture as with
the light ol a returning golden age.

The lust lines should also incidentally fir the date oi the Epistle. With respect
to the difficulty caused by the reference to Agrippa's conquest of the Cantabri
see general Introd. to the Epistles, p. 208.
