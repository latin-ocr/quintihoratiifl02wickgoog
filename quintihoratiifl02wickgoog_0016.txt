and on the other for the settling in the Sabine farm, and the other
changes which the Satires of Book II presuppose, the date of rac. 35
usually assigned for the publication of Book Ι will seem to be not
far wrong.

§3. Date ofBook II.

The publication of Book II must on the ground of the references
already discussed in Sat. 2. 6 be put after the winter of rac. 31. If
the connection of Caesar with the Parthians irr Sat. 2. r. 15
‘labentis equo . . . volnera Parthi,’ and 2. 5. 62 ‘iuvenis Parthis
horrendus,’ be held to refer to the interview of Octavianus with
Tiridates during his progress through Asia in rae. 30¹ we must put

it some months later. In any case the absence of any allusion to
the triple triumph and the closing of the temple of Janus seems to
show that the book was published before the year rac. 29, whether
before or after the Epodes cannot be positively determined.

§4 Satires 2 and 7 os Book I.

In fixing the general date of the composition of Book 1 we have
omitted three Satires which contain no reference verbal or construc-
tive to the acquaintance with Maecenas. Of these Satire 4 has
nothing to separate it in tone or topic from its neighbours. It was
written at some time after Sat. 2, and when Horace felt it necessary
if he published that Satire to apologise for its spirit. Satires 2 and
7 however have features which distinguish them from the rest of the
Book. Satire 7 tums on a ludicrous incident which occurred in the
proconsular court of Brutus when he was in Asia in the year before
the battle of Philippi, and while Horace was in his suite. It culmi·
nates in the Jest on the name of Rex, in connection with Brutus’
political antecedents‚—‘ qui reges consueris tollere.' The play on
names is of just the kind in which Roman taste delighted ; and it is
quite intelligible that having been one of Horace’s first essays in
composition, perhaps one which had been shown to Maecenas by
Virgil when he ‘told him what Horace was like‚’ the Satire may
have been retained, possibly at Maecenas' desire. It is less likely
that it should have been composed when Horace had begun to
beware of playing with edged tools.

su„ 2 has other signs of date earlier than that of the bulk of the
Book. There is the grossness of tone (never congenial to Horace,
but always bearing the look of a concession to a supposed ‘operis
