386 INTRODUCTION TO THE ARS POETICA.

possible that they may have been due to direct imitation, but on the
one hand Horace’s poem is an Epistle, with the links oi thought, the
proportion ol topics, the personal purpose, which belong to an
Epistle, on the other hand we may be sure that in criticism, as
in philosophy, he put himself into the hands of no single master,
‘nullius addictus iurare in verba' His eye throughout is primarily
on Roman poetry, not on Greek. He has his own purpose, which
could not be Neoptolemus’s‚ and everything contributes to that He
is bringing to bear on a literary question the same shrewd judgnrent
and the same standing principles which he has applied in other
poems to moral questions. A large part ol Michaelis' treatise is
taken up with disproving propositions which would now scarcely be
advanced‚ as that the Epistle was built upon Plato’s Phaedrus or
Aristotle's Poetics. The same general answer holds towards these ·
as is made to Porphyrion's statement about Neoptolemus, with the
additional weight given by the fact that in these cases we bave the
works which he is said to have taken as his guides‚ and can measure
exactiy his debt rothem. But some debr there is. The figure with
which the poem opens is most probably due to a remembrance oi
Plat. Phaedr, and the parallelisms, both in thought and expression,
between Horace and the PoeticS, though they are always accom-
panied by divergences which show that he is writing independently,
are yet probably too close not to imply some memory os the text ot'
Aristotle ¹. In one passage (vv. 161-174) we seem to find not
slavish imitation, but full remembrance of some chapters in the
Rhetoric.
