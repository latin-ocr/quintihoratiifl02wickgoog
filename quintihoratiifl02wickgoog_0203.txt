198 HORATII SATIRARUM

tronomic art, but the results are shown in paradoxes, not in perlection. There
is display and yet meanness (cp. A. P. 374, 375). The sketches os the sour
‘scurrae' are drawn in a t'ew strokes. Vibidius the hard drinker and Balatro
the bufioon. both presumiug on their relation to the great man to quiz or
patronize the host. Nomentanus and Porcius (sor their names see on v. 23) playiug
to Nasidienus, and making the most ο1 their own supper. It will be noticed that
Maecenas is not mentioned.

The affectation ot gastronomlc preciseness in this Satire will be compared
with the fourth Satire. It is perhaps meant as a specimen ot the kind ο1 talk
at supper-tables which moved Horace's spicea, aud which he laughed at more
elaborately in that Satine.

tanus was so placed in order to point out to Maecenas the secrets ο1 the
banquet.

lectured us on the proper time to piclr apples. Vou must ask him what the
reasons were.

33-41. ‘Vibidius determincd to take out his rer‘enge, asked ior larger cups, which
made our host turn pale. He dislikes hard drinkerS, probably because
