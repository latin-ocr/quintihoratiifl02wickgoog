Ne quid tu perdas neu sis iocus.'' Ire domum'atque
Pelliculam curare iube; fi cognitor ipse,

Persta atque obdura, seu rubra Canicula findet
Infantes statuas, seu pingui tentus omaso

Furius hibernas cana nive conspuet Alpes.

Nonne vides, aliquis cubito stantem prope tangens
inquiet, ut patiens, ut amicis aptus, ut acer?
Plures adnabunt thurini et cetaria crescent.

Si cui praeterea validus male filius in re

Praeclara sublatus aletur, ne manifestum

Caelibis obsequium nudet te, leniter in spem
Adrepe officiosus, ut et scribare secundus
