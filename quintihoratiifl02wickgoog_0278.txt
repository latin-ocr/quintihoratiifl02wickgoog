EPISTLE Xlll.

TO VINIUS ASINA.

Trrts professes to be a letter addrassed to one Vinius Asina who is conveying
some poems ol Horace to the Emperor: the letter is supposed to be sent alter the
messenger to reiterate instructions already given as to the care und taet to be
observcd in discharging his commission.

It seems obvious that it is an ‘ Epistle' inform only: being analogous in this
respect to Epp. 1. 20, lor it is intended primarily lor Augustus, to whom it oliersa
jesting apology sor any untimeliness in the poet's presenmtion ol his poems. Itis
a dramatis rendering ol the cantion in approaehing Caesar which he recognizes as
necessary in Sat. 2. r. 18-20, and ol the apologetic tone with which he addresses
the Emperor directly in Epp. ι, 1. 1-4. Much ol the point and ot' the imsgery ot'
the Epistle lies in the play on the family name os the messenger, a play in which
the Romans delighted, and which seems not to have been necessarily offensive to
those who bore the name.

For further questions as to personality ol Vinius, the nature oi the ‘ carmina* ot'
v. 17, and of the circumstances imagined see the additional note at the end os the
Epistle.

'l'he Epistle should be compared with the poem (5. 6) in which Martia} begs
Parthenius to introduce his boolr unobtrusively to Domitian's notice.

¹·5· ‘Let me repeat the orders 1 gare you on starting. You are to gire Augustus
my poema at the right moment, not bore him with them.

6—9. Reiuse the commissioni at once rather than discharge it so as to recall your
family name oi Asina.

ro-r 5. An ass’s strength by all means in overcomiug the difficulties of the erraud;
but once arrived you have still to watch your opportunity ior presenting the
book, and for that yon want grace and tact.

16-19. Don't tell any one your errand. Now away with you, and have a care ol
stnmbling.’
