320 HORATII EPISTULARUM

Temperat Alcaeus, sed rebus et ordine dispar,

Nec socerum quaerit quem versibus oblinat atris, 30
Nec sponsae laqueum famoso carmine nectit.

Volgavi fidicen3 iuvat immemorata ferentem

Ingenuis oculisque legi manibusque teneri.

Scire velis mea cur ingratus opuscula lector 35
Laudet ametque domi, premat extra limen iniquus:
