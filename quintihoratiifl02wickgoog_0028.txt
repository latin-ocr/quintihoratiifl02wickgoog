SATIRE l.

THE FOLLY ΟΕ WISHING INSTEAD OF ENJOYING.

Tffls folly is seenin its extreme form in the hoarder of money. His *casa his
unreasonableness and the vanity of his excuses, are set out at length, but the Sauro
begins and ends more generally. Men are always wishing for what they have not,
and so they do not enjoy what they have, and when life is over do not feel thar
they have had their share.

Verses 1-12 state the difficulty generally. The world is a scene of discontent-
restlessness-every one wishing to be what he ia not. .

(13-41). The absurdity of this is shown by two consideratione.

13—22. (a) That if yon could imagine men’s wishes granted, they would not make
the exchange. The wish is not a real one.

²3·41· (b) Thnt if you take the great object of wishing and motivo of action,
money, every oue, whatever his profession, will tell you that he seelrs it for an
end—give him nn assured competence and he looks to retire. He is lilre the
ant storing for winter. ls hei The ant when winter comes uses its store and
censes from worlr, bnt the sceler after money never stops while there is a man
left richer than himself.

(ar-107). Horace then proceeds to argue more fully with theman who accumulates
bnt does not nse. partly directly, partly imagining and replying to pleas which
he may he supposed to urge for himself.

41, 4²· What is the pleasure of storing, however large an amount of precious metat,
in the earth?

43, 44. 'If you once touch the beap it melta away! But surely it is meant to be
touched.

45-50. The pleasure is measured not by the siae of the store hut by the capacity of
enjoyment. However full your barns are yon can't eat more than 1 can.

5¹· ‘lt is pleasant to feel thot you are drawing from a large store'

52-60. It makes no difference if the amount we draw is the same. Nay, it does
make a difference in another way. 1 prefer the clear and quiet little spring to
the dangerous and turbid river.

⁶1, 62. ‘Where are we to scopi Α man is estimated by his possessions.'

6347. It is useless arguing—tbe miser is so wrapt ln his seli-esteem. If the people
hiss him he will applnud himself.

68-79. Yon are lilre Tantalus, thirsting amid water. Money has definite uses—-
yon get none of its pleasures-all its pains.

80-83. ‘At least money secures help in sickness.’

⁸4·9¹· Yon are alienating the love ready formed for yon⁸ and which yon might so
easily retain.
