SATIRE Vl.

nne rassounn’s sort.

Verses 1-6. k'outt princely Etruscan lineage does not lead yon, Maecenas, to
do what many do, despise such humbly bom people as me the ‘t'recdman's
son!

7-18. You think ii a man is himself free bom it matters little what his parents
were, and your historical reasoning is soced: Servius Tullius was not the lirst
oi no ancestry who lived bononrably and climbed to great position; ou the
other hand not ‘all the blood os all ¹ the Valerii made even the Roman people,
lor all their worship of ancestry, think laevinus worth anything. How much
sounder should our judging be 1

19-26. It bno doubt all sair in political matters. It serves me right, it I, thougha
Decius, am rejected in favour oi a Laevinus, or it an Appius as Censor strikes
me off the senate. Why can't 1 be contented with my own placei But the
well born have no monopoly ol ioolish ambition. Yon, Tillius, had better have
rested without trying to regain your tribune’s rank. Yon were less exposed to
envy.

27-44. When a man gains a public position he makes the world ask about his
birth, as a man who sets up as a good-looking follow makes them pull his
features to piecea. ‘A slave¹s son going to order the execution oi citizens'?
‘Nay, Novius my colleague isa rank lower still! ‘That does not make
you nn aristocrat. Besides he has a stentorian voice, that is his claim
on us.'

45-64 To go back to mysell. People carped at me aa ⁶ a ireedman's son’ whenl
wasa military tribune. They do so now because 1 am admitted to your
house. The first perhaps was sair, the second is not. There was no luck
about it. It was no chance introduction. Virgil and Varius told you what
Iwas like. When 1 was introduced to yon 1 was too much abashed to say
much, but at least 1 made no pretensions. Isaid what was true about my
birth and state. Yon answered little, but nine months alter you sent sor me
and gave me a place iu your friendship. 1 velue this because 1 take it as a
compliment not to my birth bnt to myselt'.

65-84. At the same time any merite ol character that Ipossess, I am eager to
acknowledge, 1 owe to my father, Poor as be was be insisted on giving me
the best education. He brought me to Rome, spared nothing on me, would
trust me to no ‘custos' but himself. He guarded me not only from actual evil
butirum breath oi reproaoh.

85-97. He did not mind if it ended in my coming down to his own trade aiter all
-1 bave not done so, and 1 owe him all the more credit and thanks Never
in my seneen could 1 be ashamed oi such a father. Ihave no inclination to
apologiae lor him. 1 would not change him is 1 could.

98-109. The world may think this maduess, but you will perhaps think it a proot'
oi sense; lor position brings burdens, duties, expenses Now 1 may live as
1 liker no one will accuse meos meanness aa they do Tillius.
