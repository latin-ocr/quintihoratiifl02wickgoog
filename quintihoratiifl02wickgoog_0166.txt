praises oi country lise in Epod. a by putting them into the mouth olibe ‘ fenerator
Alfius’ He chooses ior the purpose an Epicurean oi the last generation, known
to him chiefly, perhaps only, as having been laughed at by Cicero. ·

a. Both Aer. and the Comm. Cruq„ though giving the theory just stated
at the beginning oi the Satire, aud referring to it again on v. 88, have a note
ou v. 47, which, unless it is corrupt, must belong to a rival tradition as to
the person oi Catius and the point oi the Satire. ln its inllest form it runs
‘irridet eum quod de opere pistorio in suo libro scribit de se ipso: Haec primus
invenit et cognovit Catius Miltiades.¹ Nothing else is known oi such a work
or person. Orelli, who leans to this explanation, imagines him to have been .
afreedman oi Cicero’s Catius.

3. Α third view was suggested by Mauso, aud is advocated warmly by Proi.
Palmer. It is that Catius is a pseudonym intended thinly to veil the name
oi C. Matius, the correspondent oi Cicero (see especially ad Fam. 11. η and 28),
and the friend oi Julius Caesar and ot' Augustus. Columella tells us that he
wrote a book ou the art oi coolrery, divided into three parts, which were called
severally Coquns, Cetarius, Salgamarius. Pliny speaks oi his haring given his
name to an apple (N. H. 15. 14).

In any case the humour oi the Satire probably consisted mainly ln the mixture
oi truisms and paratiores ou the subject, and in the introduction oi authority
in a matter where each man should be allowed his own taste. Orelli well
comparesset. a. a. 51 ‘Si quis nunc mergos suaves edixerit assos Parebit pravi
docilis Romana iuventus!

Notice also that the topics iollow the usual course oi a Roman supper ⁴ ab ovo
ad mala' (Sat. 1. 3. 6).

UNDE et quo Catius? ‘Non est mihi tempus aventi
Ponere signa novis praeceptis, qualia vincent

Pythagoran Anytique reum doctumque Platona?

Peccatum fateor, cum te sic ternpore laevo

Interpellarim; sed des veniam bonus oro. 5
Quod si interciderit tibi nunc aliquid, repetes mox,
