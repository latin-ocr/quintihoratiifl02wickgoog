160 HORATII SATIRARUM

SATIRE 1V.

CATIUS, OR THE ART OF DINING·

Hostes meets Catius hurrying home to arrange his notes ot' a gastronomical
lecture which he has just heard. When pressed to name the lecturer he makes
a mystery oi it, buthe gives the heads oi the lecture (1—10).

lt comprised hints on choosingeggs(11-14)‚ cabbage (15, 16). on dressing
a sowi hastily so as to bc tender (ry-20), ou choosing mushrooms (20, ar), ou
the wholesomeuess oi certain articles oi diet (ar-29), the season and locality
oi various shellfish (30-34), the importauoe ol stndying sauces (35-39)‚ subtle
points with respect to the condition and age of various animals, fish, and birds
(40-46)‚ the error oi couceutrating attention on one thing iu a banquet and
iorgetting others equally important (47-50), the treatment oi different wiues
(51·57)· and the way to keep a drinker in taste ior his wine (58-62), the com·
position oi the ‘ simple' and ‘double' sauoe (63-69), the choice oi apples and
grapes ior dessert (707²), the garnishing ol the table (73-75), siae ol dishes,
tricis oi slaves, importauce oi cleanliness in arrangements (76-87).

The Satire ends with Horaoe‘s expressions of admiration and earnest entreaty
to be taken where such lore aud secrets of happiness were to be learnt (88-95).

who was Catius, and what ls his relation to the gastronomic lecture of which
he is the mouthpiecei It can hardly be a name which carried uo associandis,
t'or the mma would lack point.

1. The Scholiasts give us a complete answer and one which meets fairly the
conditious. They say (r) that Catius was an Epicurean who had written a
treatise ‘de Rerum Natura et desummo bono'; (a) that in this Satire Horace
is playing with the Epicureans as in the last he played with the Stoics.

It is a striking confirmation of this statement that (as they do not say) a Catius
is named in one ol Cicero’s letters (ad Fam. 15. 16). He is rallying Cassius on
his Epicurean teuets, and quotes jestinglya uae oi the term ‘spectra’ by ‘Catius
Insuber Epicureus qui nuper est mortuus‘ If this is the person meant the
dramatic srameworlr ol this Satire will turn. as does that ol the first and os the
third Satira iu this book, ou a character lrom Cicero‘s Epistles.

Some such play as the Scholiasta suggest suits well enough with Horace’s
altitude towards rival philosophies, with his principle oi placing his poems
(whether Satires, Episties, or Odes) as compauion or contrasted pictures. and
possibly with hints iu the satire itsell*. We need not make this relation between
Catius and the discourse ou coolrery very close. Horaoe's primary purpose was
probably to laugh at people who made gastronomy into a scieuce and professed
to know better than their neighbours how to cook a chiclren or arrange a dinner
table (cp. the play ol Sat. a. 8). 1t occurred to him to give a further point to
thesaure by its lramiug and placing, much as be gives a point to the idyllic

⁴¹ lt is difficule to know how much one reads intoa poem when once a theory oi its purpose
is conceind, but whatever hints ot' pla there are seem to point in this direction. Catius i
v. 3 speaks os the lecture as a philoaopi'y: that he does not name E icurus may be dramatic.
Horace in v. 95 welcornes the reaching as an art os living, not only odolung, ‘vitae praece ta
beatae: and parodica the famous words oi Lucretius, as though to suggest that it is a ncw ‘im
Rerum Natura' that we have been listening to. Add the reference to the attitude os the
‘sapiens' in the presence of these problema (v. μ), the criticism oi a previous reaches (v. 24), the
anoeration ol such terms as ‘praecepta.' ‘quaesita' 'ingenium' ‘natura' ‘ratio'
