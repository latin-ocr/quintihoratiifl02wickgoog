288 HORATII EPISTULARUM

detail defecta of Quintins' character to snit the turns of the poet's lecture. Its
personui bearing is probably satisfied with ‘we are all calling you happy, only
remember what the Stoics tell us happiness really means? We have seen in Epp.
1. r that Horace passos from a personal address to professorial argument with an
imagined interlocutor without indicating the point of transition (sec note on vv. 41-
43 of this Epistic'). It is to be notieed that in the present Epistle he touches in
suocession on many current Stoic doctrines, aad with sympathy, not putting in front,
as is usual with him, their paradoxical form. See notes on vv. 33, 5 5, 65, 79.

The connection between the description of the Sabine farm and the discussion
on standards of happiness and goodness which follows is not strongly marked.
We are meant probably to feel something of the easy inconsequence of a letter,
the early part finding its immediate explanation in some questions that Quintius
may be supposed to have asked. The point of actual connection is made in v. 17
by‘ Tu recte vivist’ which implies that the sum ol the picture given in the preced-
ing lines has been ‘ego recte vivo.' The retirement and simple pleasures in which
he paiuts himself as finding health and contentment are a fitting introduction to
the remainder of the letter in which he is to argue that happiness cannot be
separated from goodness, and that they both are to be sought within us, not
without us.
