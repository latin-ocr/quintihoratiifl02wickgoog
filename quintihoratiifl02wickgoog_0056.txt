Donec verba quibus voces sensusque notarent
Nominaque invenere; dehinc absistere bello,

Ne quis fur esset, neu latro, neu quis adulter.
Nam fuit ante Helenam cunnus teterrima belli
Causa, sed ignotis perierunt mortibus illi,

Quos venerem incertam rapientes more ferarum
Viribus editior caedebat, ut in grege taurus.

Tempora si fastosque velis evolvere mundi.

Nec natura potest iusto secernere iniquum,
