LIB. Ι. EPIST. 16.

EPISTLE XVI.

το nummus,

Verses 1-16. llou ask about the produce of my farm, but seem hardly to under-
stand its nature. It is in the heart of the hills, but for such a situation it has
all possible advantages-a sunny aspect, good climate, surprising richuess of
woodland fruit, and foliage, fresh water.

It isto me a paradise of beauty and safety even in September.

17-24 And now of yourself. I hope you too have found tbe secret of life.
We are all congratulating you on your good fortune-and rightly; provided
you are taking your measure of your happiness not from our words, but
from your own feelings and from philosophy.

Troe happiness belongs only to the wise and good. Are yon that?

25-31· lf the world tells you so, do not believe it at once, any more than you
would if it told yon that you were a second Augustus.

3¹·40· No doubt all feel pleasure iu being called good and wise.

But we most remember that those who give titles can talre them away. Are
we to feel pain when theydestroy our character? Such pleasure aud such pain
are alilre proofs that we are not yet good and wisc.

40. For what, to go back, do you mean by a ‘ good man 'l

41-43. The stoelr answer is ‘ the man of respectability‚ who breaks no law, whose
word is a bond, whose testimony is trusted.¹

44, 45. Nay, that is outside only. He may be a villain underneath.

46-49. Negatives do not constitute goodness‚ even in a slave.

The truly good man is good from love of virtue.

545⁶· Truegoodnessimpliesmotiveaswellasact. The pretender to goodness
is often kept straight by fear of punishment.

57-62. But his true desire is not to be good but to seem good, in order that he
may the better gratify his love of gain.

63-68. There is the true motive, and that makes the man who feelsit a slave.

69-72. Yon may make a uscful shepherd of him, or ploughman, or trader, but not
a philosopher.

73-79. The truly wise and good man is lilre Dionysus in the play. He fears no
one, wants nothing, cau never lose his liberty, for he has in his own hands
the key of liberty.

lt is characteristic of Horace’s irony that an Epistle in which, more than in most.
he assumes the tone of a Stoic and mounts the professor's pulpit, follows one in
which hc has described himself as a second Maenius.

Who Quintius was, and to what extent he was meant to take home the lecture,
we cannot tell. It may be the‘Qointius Hirpinus,' to whom Horace addresses
counsels in a very different vein in Od. a. 11. It is to be said however that the
total ignorancc which is presumed in him of the poet's country house does not
point to a friend of long standing, and that the tone of v. 17 foll, if it does not
require, certainly suits well with, a friend young in years towards whom congratu-
lations on some early success may not unbecomingly be followed up, by an elder,
with some good. advice. We need not imitate some editors in drawing out in
