GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO
BOOKI OF THE EPISTLES.

Date ofthe Book.

Tua Second Book of Satires and the Epodes were published
between the years 31 and 30 ac. The three Books of the Odes
occupy the next seven years of Horace’s life and were published,
as seems almost certain (see vol. 1. p. 2), in uc. ²3· He may
have written some of the Epistles before that time, but all which
can be dated fall into the years between 23 and 20 (or 19 at the

Florus, who is at the time accompanying the future emperor Tiberius
in his progress into Armenia, i. e. it is composed in nc. 20.
Epistles 8, 9 and 11 have possibly links with the same event.
Epistle 18 is fixed to the same year by the words ‘Sub duce, qui
templis Parthorum signa refigit’ an evident reference to the restora-
tion by the Parthians of the standards taken at Chartae, which was
an incident in that progress. In 12. 26-28 this event is again
referred to and with it another which causes a little more difficulty:

‘Cantaber Agrippae, Claudi virtute Neronis
Armenius cecidit; ius imperiumque Phraates
Caesaris accepit genibus minor)
