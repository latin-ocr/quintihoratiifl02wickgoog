THE LITERARY EPISTLES. 333

same person that is named in Cic. ad Fam. 7. 1, as having had the
approval of the plays which should be acted in Pompey's theatre in
nc, 54 (see on Sat. 1. 10. 38), he would have been an old manin
ae. 10-8. But it is clear that there are some loopholes. We cannot
be sure that there was not asecond Maecius. We need not assume,
with some writers on the point, that Cicero’s Maecius was a man
already in middle liie; the point oi the complaint may be that
Pompey had trusted such a delicate duty to the immature judgment
of a elever young friend. Or Bentley may have been right in
his suggestion that Horace means only ‘a Maecius‚' i.e. a critic like
Maecius, as he calls a physician ‘Craterus¹' because Craterus was
the physician of Cicero's lettere.

2. The management of the laxamur. This question has been
examined very fully by Wahz’, and in some special points by
A. Michaelis. That there is a striking change between the Hexa-
meter of Horace’s earlier and later poems is obvious. It has begun
within the Satires, but the great divergence is when we pass from
the Satires to the Epistles oi Book 1. This is just where the seven
years’ training oi his ear in lyrical composition might be expected to
telland where the influence osVirgil would be likely to have modilied
that of Lucretius and Lucilius. On the one side there is a marked
diminution in some Lucretian liberties and roughnesses, such as the
monosyllabic endings (‘ ridiculus mus’), the quadrisyllabic endings
(ί libertino patre natum ’), broken rhythms at the beginning (‘ denique
quatenus,' ‘ille repotia ’)‚ the elision osmonosyllables. On the other,
we can perhaps trace a compensating development os the more
Virgilian rhythms which attain variety in a different and more har-
monious manner. When these changes are expressed ina tabular
iorm the Ars Poetica is judged to stand more nearly with the
Epistles of Book 2 than with those oi Book 13 but any arguments
based on this must be handled very cautiously. The comparison
between Book 1 and Book 2 is itseli delusive; ior there are probably
six years between the two Epistles oi Book a, and the Epistle to
Florus is near in date to the Epistles of Book 1. Michaelis also
points out with what small ligures we are dealing in any such
comparison of licenses as between the Epistles. Between the Satires
and Epistles the change is great; between one Epistle or set of

Epistles and another it is small. Again accident plays a part in ’

such variations 3 and in all Horace's poems rhythms change per-
