has lasted a little while. Horace looks back on its stages (6. 54-62) ;
it has stood some tests (3. 6 3—6 5); people are still curious about it,
and yet some are already secking to profit by it (5 and 9). Now if
we can date Sat. 2. 6, Horace gives us in it the means of also dating
approximately the commeneement of his close relations to Maecenas:
for in v. 40 he says-

‘Septimus octavo propior iam fugerit annus

Ex quo Maecenas me coepit habere suorum
In numero! (With the last words cp. Sat. 1. 6. 62.)

The expression is not perfectly clear, but'this probably means ‘It is
seven or rather very nearly eight full years since,' etc. There is also
the doubt, which always attaches to Roman reckoning, whether this
is to be taken exclusively or inclusively, to mean what we should also
call ‘seven years verging on eight,’ or what we should rather call ‘six
verging on seven! The date of the Satire itself can be fixed withina
few months, but not more closely. Three indicationsof time are
given in it. (ι) Inv. 38 the words ‘Imprimat his, cura, Maecenas signa
tabellis' seem to refer to the time of the ‘bellum Actiacum' and the
following events, during which Maecenas (in conjunctiora later with
Agrippa) had the charge of affairs in Rome and Italy for Octavianus
and bore his signet ring ¹. (2) In v. 53 Horace represents as one
of the questions put to him by persons who credited him with know·
ing state secrets, ‘numquid de Dacis audistii' The Daci are men-
tioned by Dion as offering their services to Octavianus before the
battle of Actium, and, on his declining them, to Antony⁹t and it
is evident that they continued to be acause of some anxiety at
Rome, for he speaks of Crassus being sent against them in ac. 30.
(3) In v. 55 another question asked of him is, ‘militibus promissa
Triquetra Praedia Caesar an est Itala tellure daturus?' The allo
cation referred to is probably 'that after Actium, and the moment at
which this question would be most in men's mouths would be
in the winter of nc. 31, when Dion reports that so serious a mutiny
broke out among the disbanded soldiers, who feared they were to
be disappointed of their rewards, that Octavianus had to pay a
hasty visit to Italy and provide for the assignment of lands to them ³.

Of these dates (1) would suit any time from the middle of ac. 31
to the retum of Octavianus to Rome in 29: (a) would be, so far as
we know, best satisfied in ac. 31 or 30: (3) points most definitely
to the winter of ac. 31, though the form of reference does not ex·
