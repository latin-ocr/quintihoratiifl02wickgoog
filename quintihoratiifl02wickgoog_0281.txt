Romel If ao, it has been suggested that the Sosii (Epp. r. ro. 2) who would
have prepared the copy, would be the more natural agents in its delivery; also
that the imagery ol a joumey ‘per clivos, flumina, lamas,' even ii it be in part
at least metaphorical, seems less appropriate to such a short and well-beaten rond
