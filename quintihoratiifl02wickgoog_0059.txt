48 HORATII SATIRARUM

Ignoscent si quid peccaro stultus amici,
Inque vicem illorum patiar delicta libenter,
Privatusque magis vivam te rege beatus.

AN APOLOGY FOR WRlTlNG SATIRE.

IT should be noticed that Horace in v. 71 ioll. expressly repudiates the idea oi
publishing his Satires He composes them ior his own pleasnre and proiit, aud

only reads them to friends, und when pressed to do so.
With this Satirc should be compared Sat. 1. 3. nuri 2. r.

Verses 1—7. Satine iu Lucilius’ hands came straight from the great comio poets
oi Greeoe, who, when they saw a rogue, had no scruple in pointing him as
such. The spirit is identicul, the metre only changed.

7-13. lu spite oi high merits he iailed in point ol form, from thinking oi quantity

' rather than quality.

13—21. Thut is the mistakc oi people like Crispinus, not mine.

²1-38· Yet this does not secure me popularity. Poetasters,lilre raninchus
same, but I have not ventured to publish, und I have not the courage to recite.
Why ia Satire nnpopulari Because so many people know that its shaits may
fairly be aimed nt them. They accuse the poet oi truding on the wcuknesscs
oi his friends.

38-56. llcar my reply. let me say first that they do me too great honour ii they
call me u ‘poet' Ido not claim the name. Itis au old question whether
comedy is poetry. Its lauguage is the langunge oi common lise :

56-62. its passion the passion oi common life. Tulce to pleces a line oi Ennius,
and the fragments are the fragments oi a poet. Do the same ior Lucilius,
und you hare nothing that marks the poet.

63-65. But we will leave this question, and usk again why Satire is looked on so
jealously.

65-78. Yon suggest that my trade is that oi the informer. I might nnswer that it
is the guilty, not the innocent. who dread even the informer. But I am very
unlilrc un informer. 1 seelr no publicity, even in days when no place is secred
from recitafions.

78-79. You suy I taire pleasure iu giving pain.

79-91. Yon must usk my friends about that. True malignity is to be found iu the
gossip ol private lise. But you who are so much ou the loolr out ior malignlty
listen with pleasure to the illnatnred buiioonery oi the supper table.
