414 HORATII ARS POETICA.

Nomen iambeis, cum senos redderet ictus
Primus ad extremum similis sibi. Non ita pridem,
Tardior ut paulo graviorque veniret ad aures,
Spondeos stabiles in iura paterna recepit
Commodus et patiens, non ut de sede secunda
Cederet aut quarta socialiter. Hic et in Acci

Visuros peccata putem mea, tutus et intra
Spem veniae cautus? Vitavi denique culpam,
Non laudem merui. Vos exemplaria Graeca
