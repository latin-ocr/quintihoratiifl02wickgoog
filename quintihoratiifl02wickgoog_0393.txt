characteristies oi human nature in each ol the stages oi life. These mnst be
wellstudied.

carried to the extent oi producing revoltiug or marvellous seenes on the
stage.

189-192. Five acts, no more aad no less. A ‘deus ex machina' only when the
occasion really requires it. Three characters only on the stage at once.

193-201, On the other hand the Chorus must be treated as an integral part oi the
drama. Its business is to help on the aetion, and specially to take the moral
and religione side in it.

roa-219. The lyrical part oi the drama was simplet in old days. As audienoes
have become more mixed the music became more elaborate, the diction more
stilted, the tone more oracular.

azo-239. (In the same way) the desire to interest a miscellaneous audience led
to adding the Satyris drama to tragedy. But moderation and tnet are
necessary. Tragia characters must not be lowered in the following Satyric
drama. Neither need they rant. Tragedy has its proper dignity; so has
the Satyric drama itseli. It is not tragedy, but neither is it comedy.

²40·²43· Do not look ior an original story, only ior freshness oi treatment.

1 nm trying to teaeh others to write it, asa whetstone makes knives cut
though it cannot cut itseli.

309·3¹8· Good writing begins in good thinking. Read Plato, understand human
