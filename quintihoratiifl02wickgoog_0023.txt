12 GENERAL lNTRODUCTlON

a. Some anecdotes and allusions are confessedly due to older
poets, and it is certain that the list might be extended if we
possessed Lucilius and the latin dramatists in anything more than
fragments. ln Sat. a. a. 47 Horace reserato Gallonius as having
introduced the ‘acipenser ' to Roman tables and speaks of the evil as
having happened ‘haud ita pridem! But this is from Lucilius,
a fragment to the effect being quoted by Cic. de Fin. 2. 8. 24. Three

names which are found in Lucilius throw some light on Horace's
methods of employing the names he found in his predecessors.
(ι) Pacideianus& In Lucilius (4. 17) he is the ‘best gladiator since the
beginning of the world! In Horace Sat, a. 7. 98 his name is given
casually as one of the three gladiators, the rough walldrawing of
whose performance fascinates Davus. If Horace usesaliterary name
here instead of a contemporary one, where may he not be doing so'?
(2) Maenius. We know of Lucilius’ use of the name from Porph. on
Hor. Sat 1. 3. 21, who quotes as from the older poet, ‘Maenius
columnam curn peteret’ and interprets it by the story that Maenius,
when his horne was sold over his head, reserved a column of it,
thence called ‘Maenii columna’ from whence he might see the
gladiators. This is evidently a foolish invention to connect Maenius
with the column, due to some one who did not know that the
‘columna Maenia’ was erected in honour of Maenius, thc colleague
of Camillus, in ac. 338. We may suppose rather that in Lucilius
there was a play on Maenius (ie. some spendthrift) ‘making sor bis
own column,' i.e. subjecting himself to the jurisdiction of the ‘ trium-
viri capitales,' who sat by the columna Maenia; cp. the play in Cic,
pro Sest. 8. 18. In any case ‘Maenius’ is to Horace a name that
occurs when hewants one for a good-for-nothing fellow, the ‘pot that
blackens the kettle’ in Sat. 1. 3. 21, the glutton and spendthrift in
Epp. 1. 15. 26 f, possibly also the associate os Nomentanus in Sat.
1. 1. ror. (3) Nomentanus is a name which occurs in Horace in four
different contexts. In the place just referred to he is with Naevius
(or Maenius) the type of a spendthrift. In ¹: 8. 11 he stands with
‘Pantolabus scurra' as a representative of those who ruin themselves
and come to a pauper’s burial. The line is repeated in 2. r. 22 as a
specimen of Horace’s personal satire. In 2. 3. 175 and 224 he is
