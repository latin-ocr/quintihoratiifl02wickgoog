8 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

as himself had ‘had three names¹.’ But the talk comes baclr again
always to life and conduct, men’s tastes and inconsistencies, the true
path of happiness. We have sketches of lile in Rome, of different
phases of it from the point of view of bystanders‚ the honest country-

· man, the Stoic lecturer, the slave, the man of letters at the supper table

of the rich upstart 3 sketches of tallras it shouldn't be, talk about eating
and drinking; sketches of personal and social vices, of avarice and
the transparent excuses for it, of censoriousness, of vulgar pushing, of
legacy-hunting.

Politics we miss altogether. Political satire belongs to the age ·’

before the proscriptions, to the age when power belonged to an
oligarchy, cultivated at least enough to read and to be amused, not to
the two masters, or the one master, of legions. And Horace was not
by nature a politician. He had had an enthusiasm and a disappoint-
ment. He never became a tumcoat ready at command to bespatter
his old party. He was attracted by what promised to be an epoch of
order and refinement. The re'gr'me of Octavianus meant to him the
rc‘gr'me of Maecenas, with Virgil and Varius in the background. On
the other hand his most continuous attraction was in moral questions.
His standard was not ours ; but he had been brought up well by
a manly and virtuous father. He was an acute observer of life, he had
good taste, strong sense,a natural shrinking from excess of every
kind. The professed teachers of the day seem to have repelled
rather than attracted him. The Stoic lecturers survive for us in his
gibes at their tediousness and dogmatism and in his caricature of
their paradoxical teaching. Epicureanism was recommended to him
by having found an exponent in a great poet ; and accordingly, in
Sat. 1 at least, the inliuence of Lucretius dominates his philosophical
views as well as his diction and rhythms. But he plays with
Epicureanism as he does with Stoicism. His heart is with the
‘abnormis sapiens! He is beginning to feel, what he asserts more
roundly in the Epistles, that Homer is a better teacher than any of
the schools. He seels, no doubt, another inliuence in the treatises of
Cicero, of whom he was a diligent student, but Cicero again teaches
him to be interested in all philosophies, and to bind himself to none.

The term ‘Sermones' then, was part of the εἰρωνεία, natural and

assumed, which marks so deeply the Satires as well as the rest of
Horace's writings. They were ‘talks,’ not ‘Satires' He was
preaching, but he would preach in the least obtrusive way. He mis-
doubts his right to preach. He is always inclined to turn the laugh
