282 HORATll EPISTULARUM

EPISTLE XV.

ΤΟ vam.

Titus is one oi the Epistles which carry on their sace more of the occasion and
purpose oi a true letter. Horace writes to Vala as one well acquainted with the
eoast in that part oi Italy to ask about Velia and Salernum as winter resorts; ex·
plaining by the way why he is not going as usual to Baiae: ‘It is not my fault,
hut that oi Antonius Musa, who has pnt me on the eold water treatment: yet, no
doubt,1 am looked upon at Baiae as a traitor and renegade.’ The questions
which he asks (with this interpolated explanation in vua-13) last until v. ²5·
The remainder oi the Epistle is occupied with nn ironical apology sor the incon·
sisteney between these particular enqniries as to the luxuries to be had at the
southern watering-places and the tone os eontented Stoicism with which his friends
at this time were familiar. ‘Yon see aiter all I ain like Maenius, a philosopher
whenI must be so, a bon-vivant when I can‘ (vv. 26-46). This turn oi the
Epistle has been prepared sor by the parenthesis (vv. iti-ar), in which he explains
tltat he asks about the water rather than the wine oi the country, not that he means
to drink water, but because, although at home at his farm he can drink anything,
at the seaside he wants something better than ‘vin du pays)

Missing the connection oi thought, some of the best MSS. divide the Epistle, be·
ginning a new one at v. 26 (see introd. to Ode 1. 7).

Oi the Vala oi this Epistle, called Numenius Vala in the heading given in several
MSS, we know nothing certainly. 'l he name oi Q. Numonius Vala has been
found inan inscription* at Paestum—haii-way, that is, between Salernum and Velia.
We gather srorn the Epistle that he was well acquainted with both placeS‚ and irom
v. 46, probably, that he had a handsome country house in the neighbourhood.
One Numenius Vala met an inglorious death in the German campaign oi A.n.9
under Varus, but there is izothing to identiiy the two.

We may note in the Epistle the recurreuce to the topic oi his own inconsistency,
especially in respect oi his love os simplieityand pietensions to philosophy. He is
consciens that such charges are made against him, and he meets them sometimes
with denial‚ sometimes with playful and hali-ironical consessions. ll'e must not
be misled by these, or suppose that he really attributes to himself the same motiues
as to Maenius. His true auswer is little more than ‘there is a time ior every-
thing.’ In the last Epistle he preachcd that inconsistency was sometimes the truest
consisteney.

Veliae, the Greek Ἐλέα, on the coast a. quatis vie, ‘what the road isiike ‘;
some twenty-five miles south oi Paestum, a question always os interest in Horace.
