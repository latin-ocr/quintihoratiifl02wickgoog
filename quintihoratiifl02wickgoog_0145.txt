140 HORATII SATlRARUM

Effugiet tamen haec sceleratus vincula Proteus.

Cum rapies in ius malis ridentem alienis,

Fiet aper, modo avis, modo saxum et cum volet arbor!

Si male rem gerere insani est, contra bene sani,

Putidius multo cerebrum est, mihi crede, Perelli, 75
Dictantis quod tn nunquam rescribere possis.

Audire atque togam iubeo componere, quisquis

Ambitione mala aut argenti pallet amore,

Quisquis luxuria tristive superstitione

Aut alio mentis morbo calet3 huc propius me, 80
Dum doceo insanire omnes, vos ordine adite.
