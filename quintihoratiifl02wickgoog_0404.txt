HORATII ARS POETICA.

Humani voltus: si vis me flere, dolendum est
Primum ipsi tibi: tunc tua me infortunia laedent,
Telephe vel Peleu3 male si mandata loqueris
Aut dormitabo aut ridebo. Tristia maestum
Voltum verba decent, iratum plena minarum,
Ludentem lasciva, severum seria dictu.

Format enim natura prius nos intus ad omnem
Fortunarum habitum; iuvat aut impellit ad iram
Aut ad humum maerore gravi deducit et angit3
Post effert animi motus interprete lingua.

Si dicentis erunt fortunis absona dicta

Romani tollent equites peditesque cachinnum.
intererit multum divusne loquatur an heros,
Maturusne senex an adhuc florente iuventa
Fervidus, et matrona potens an sedula nutrix,
Mercatorne vagus cultorne virentis agelli,

Colchus an Assyrius, Thebis nutritus an Argis.
Aut lamam sequere aut sibi convenientia finge.
