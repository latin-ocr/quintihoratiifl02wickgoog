LIB. l. EPIST. 6.

EPISTLE Vl.

TO NUMICIUS.

‘C HOOSE your “ summum bonum ‘' and having choran it persus it wirla thorough·
nass and consistemy! One who says this has his own idea of the true ‘ summum
bonurn,' and the illustratione of his principle ln the case of ideals other thau thia
must be in some degree ironical.

Verres 1, r. Assume the ‘ summum bonum' to be the ἀταραξία of the Epicureans.

3-16. Thea, see all that follows from this and remember (ry-27) how the absurdity
of overestimating sublunary things is pointed by the instability of human life.

28-31. So with all ideals. Yon are energetic iu trying to eure a pain in your side
or back. Bc the same in moral things.

lf virtue is the one road to happiness, male any sacrifices for her.

31-48. If ou the contrary there is no standard bnt a material oue, theu pnrsne with
euergy material wealth.

49—5 5. If the objects of ambition give happiness, spare uo pains on them.

56-64. If good cating, then take the shortest roads to that.

65, 66. lf love and mirth, think of nothing else than them.

67, 68. These are my principles, Numicius3 tell me frankly if you have any better
ones.

Note that the phrases which give the connection are v. 2 ‘facere et servare
beatum,' v. 29 ‘recte vivcrc,' v. 47 ‘facere et servare beatum,' v. 49 ‘fortu-
natum praestat' v. 56 ‘bene virit,’ v. 66 ‘viras in....' all expressions of the
‘summum bonnm‘ or ideal of life.

ln speaking of the philosophical idea of ἀταραξία identified with ἇθαυμαατία (see
αα v. 1), vv. 147, the hey-wordsare‘ admirari ¹ v. 1, ‘ miratur’ v.9, ‘mirare ’ v. 18,
‘mirabilis ' v. ²4·

We have no clue to the identity of Numicius. The Scholiasts are silent about
him.

ΝΗ, admirari prope res est una, Numici,
Solaque, quae possit facere et servare beatum.
Hunc solem ct stellas et decedentia certis

ι. N il admirari: cp.Strabo’s words prope, ‘is perhaps the one and only
(1. 3. 21) τὴν ἀθαυμαστίαν ἣν ὑμνεῖ thing! See on Sat. a. 3. 32 ‘stultique
Δημόκριτος καί ol ἄλλοι φιλόσοφοι πάντας ; prope omnes' aud cp. A. P. 432 ‘ faciunt
euphrateae γὰρ τῷ despuet* cul ἅταρόχφ prope plura!
eui ἀνεκπλήκτφ, aud Cicero, de Fin. una solaque. Cicero prefers ‘unus
5. ²9· 87 ‘Id enim ille [Democritus] solus'without the conjunctiou, and uses
summum bonum εὐθυμίαν et saepe ὀθαμ- it frequently. ‘Uua,’ = ‘ praecipua‘
βίαν appellat, id est animm terrore li- Notice the additional force picen by
berum! Μηδὲν θαυμάζειν is a precept or dividing ‘una' from ‘solaque, and by
aboast attributed to philoso hers of the insertion between them of the voca·
several schools, but Horace ia likely to tire which aska for special attention.

{e thinking chiefly of the ἀταραξία of the 3. huno solam, ‘yonder sun!
prcureans.
