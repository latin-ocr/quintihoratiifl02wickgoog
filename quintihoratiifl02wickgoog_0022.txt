TO THE SATIRES. 11

on his travels, as Aufidius Luscus, the jack in office at Fundi¹; some
011122 money-leaders well known about the Forum, and who could
hardlystrike again atasriendos Maecenas, Nerius, Perilliuswithhis 221212-

There are cases again in which we obviously bave allusions to
anecdotos or characters which were public property, not meant
maliciously, but the employment by way 01 illustration 01 what
was already in everyone's mouth. Such are 102 instance labeo the
type 01 2 madman ⁴, Albucius and his poison, Scaeva and his long-
lived mother, Turius the severe judget. It is possible again that
where stories or traits which reflect discredit are given the narnes
may be the veils 01 known persons more or less transparent to
Horace’s contemporaries or his immediate circle.

But there are two sources 01 1212 2222210122 and 01 1212 names, which,
though we cannot measure exactly how much is ducto each, are
certainly answerable 102 a good many, and which so 122 as they go
show that his purpose was genuinely to illustrate·and vivily his moral
descriptions, not to give pain or teach the world to sneer.

1. Itis certain that many 011212 stories and instances belong
really to the last generation⁶. His satirical sketch 01 Tigellius'
character in Sat. 1. 2. and 3 (which in the latter satire he makes
typical 011212 satiric style) relates to one who was already dead.
Fausta, ‘the daughter 01 Sulla,' takes at least one scandal 01 Sat. 1.. 2
some years back. Arbuscula the 221222-221222222211 the son 01
Aesopus, 01 whom stories are told in 1. 10. 77 and 2. 3. 239, are
persons known to us in Cicero's letters. The reference to Alienus
in 1. 3. 130, whoever be the person, is by the tense 01 ‘ erat' thrown
back to a date antecedent to the text. So is the story 01 Staberius'
will in 2. 3. 84 1., with the further indication that the ‘epulum arbitrio
Arri’ is to be illustrated from an anecdota. told by Cicero in Vatin.
