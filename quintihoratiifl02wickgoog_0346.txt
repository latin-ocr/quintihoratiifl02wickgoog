LIB. 11. EPIST. 1. 339

late in time oi Greek culture, which has been slowly driving out the old taiut
oi rudeneas and has not iully done its work yet ; the iaults, in spite oi their vigour
and spirit, oi the early writers oi tragedy and eomedy‚ in their seli-sufficiency,
haste, and eugemess to make money.

Tumiug irorn the writers oi plays he goes on (v. 177 i.) to arraigu the nudienoes
ns equally wanting in the artistic spirit. They care ior shows, not ior good plays
or acting. Lastly, aiter explaining in a iew words that in what he says he is not
undervaluing the dmmatie att, he turns (v. 214 i.) to other kinds oi poetry, and
asks Augustus' support ior them. ‘ 1 know,' he says, ‘there are many oi us who
hore yon, but there ure diiierences between us, and happily you are not like
Alexander. you know a Virgil from a Choerilus. And you will resp your reward.
Good poetry is indeed “aere perennius” 1 would do my part us your poet, iil
could, but bad poetry is worse than none.¹

The points oi the Epistle are-
1. That it is ridiculous to judge poetry hy its age not its intrinsic merit.
2. That the conditione oi the development os Romen literature had made
it certain that perfectiori would come late.
3. Thut Augustus‘ taste is a true one; that Virgil and Varius, (and it is
hinted, Horace), have taken the right wey to bc classics, and so immortul, in u
sense that their predeoessors hed not.
