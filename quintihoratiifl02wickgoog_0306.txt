EPISTLE XVII.

TO SCAEVA.

Verses 1-5. You do not need the advice of such a hnmble and inexperienoed

person ael arn as to the way to live with the great, but take it for what it is
worth.

6—12. If it be true that quiet and freedom are what you care for, the question will
not ariae—you will give up ‘society’ once and for all. There is something
to be said for that course ; but if you have hongry relations and like a good
dinner yourself, it is natural to make up to the great. Nor is that wrong.

13-17. The Cynic gibes at the Cyrenaic; but the Cyrenaic has his answer.

17-32. Neither is wholly independent, but the view of Diogenes is the narrower
and least practical of the two.

33-36. The great glories of life are for the chosen few. To win the favour of
these chiefs of mankind is another grade of distinction, and it ia not for every·
oue any more thau the first.

37-42· Some are deterred from trying by fear of failure. But here, as elsewhere, it
is not true virtue (i. e. manliness) to give up for want of trying. Only remember,
when you have found your patron, two golden mles.

43-51· r. Never ask ς you will get more and muse less envy.

52-62. r. Never gmmble; your real troubles will gain more credenee lf you have
not hored people with trifling ones.

Porph. treats Epp. 17 and 18 as one continuone Epistle, and all the Scholiasta
make Scaeva and Lollius the same person. Both are evidently mistakes, hut they
mean that the early critica perceived that the two Epistles were meant to he read
in close connection with each other. They deal with one subject, the reverse ofthat
treated in Epp. 1. 7. That spoke os the relation of a patron to his protlgl—these
of the relation of the prote‘gl to his patron. When the two Epistles are taken to·
gether they deal pretty fully with the subject. We see the matter from the patron's
side, the greed und pushing of one dependent, the servility of another, the clnmsy
attempta of a third to essert independeuce by being mde and dieobliging. We see
also the natural shrinking of many men from a questionable and difficult position.
We read between the lines Horaoe’s advice on the whole about it: ‘Keep out of it
if you can-hear yourself naturally and with aelfrespect while you are in it. Re·
member the higher ends and pleasures of life, and be content (aa 1 have been) to
make your escape early into a modest competence.'

But there are great differences between the two Epistlea The spirit of Ep. 17
seems at least half satirical. The humility of the beginning from such a master in
the art of pleasing the great (Ep. r. ao. ²9) ir overdone for complete seriousness; the
motives suggested in vv. rr, rr are too broadly put, the tone of ⁴ aut virtum omen
inane est ’ (v. 41) recalls too nearly the irony of Ep. 6 ; the two golden mles which
end the Epistle‚ as though they contained the whole art of which v. a promised to
speak. are too like an intentional bathon

Scaeva is an unknown person. Is he 1 young man with whom Horace ie on
friendly terma and in whose particular case the apparent satire has a playful tum
beyond oar guessingl Or is he a rhadow'l Is it really a Satire under the form
