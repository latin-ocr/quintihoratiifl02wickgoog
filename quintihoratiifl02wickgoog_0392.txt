DE ARTE POETICA LIBER.

verses 1-5. Yon expect a picture to represent something real: not incongruens
and impossible combinations.

6-13. ΤΙιε same rule binds n poet. What he conceives (i. e. whether as a whole
or in detuill runst be possible and whole.

14-23. This rule is violated by the ‘purple patch' system. Your becuties urust
be relevant. Remember always your purpose and its conditione.

²4-31· Blunders in this mutter proceed srorn the common falling, the incapacity
to avoid one mistake without falling into its opposite. One wunts art even
to escape tanlts.

32-37. lt is the same in sculpture. It is eusier to work up some details then to
conceive a whole. But it is ns in the human iace: s croolred nose spoils the
effect oi good eyes and hair.

38-41. The key lies in choosing a subject within your powers. Once do thet
and you will not soil either in finding plenty to say or in power to arrange it.

42-45. By arrangement 1 mean knowing when to ssy a thing, when to omit or
postpone it, the power to pick and choose.

46-72. That must be exercised in respect oi diction. Itis a very happy knaclr
to mnke an old word new by a skilsul conjunction. lion may also invent
words il it be necessary; but it must be in moderatim, und you will do well
to go to Greek as your well-spring. The old poets invented words, why uruy
not modeml Words, like other human things, have their day, and pass
and change.

73-88. The different types os poetry have been marked out by the Greek masters,
and stamped with their appropriate meires, and we must keep to them.

89-118. So generally with respect to the style of dktebn. The comio and the
tragic are distinct, though oi course to a certain extent each borrows the tone
os the other. This is owing to the larger law thnt emotion is only stirred
by emotion, and the language must correspond to the emotiou. Respect
must be had too to the characters who are speaking.

¹19-127· ln respect oi characters you may follow tradition or invent. ln either
case you have your law. Traditional characters must keep their uadinonal
features. N ewly invented ones must be consistent with their own idea.

128-r 3 5. Real originality in dealing with common things is so difficolt that yon
nre doing better to dramatize some oi the Homeris story theuto stsrt a new
plot. There isroonr ior originality still within these limite, in the choioe oi
your subject aud iu the ireedom oi your imitation.

136—152. Imitate Homer in the modesty oi your beginning, ln avoiding lengthy
and proseic introductione, ln consistency oi story.
