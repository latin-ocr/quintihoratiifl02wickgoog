Incutiat tibi quid sanctarum inscitia legum:

Si mala condiderit in quem quis carmina, ius est
Iudiciumque! Esto, si quis mala3 sed bona si ‘quis

Iudice condiderit laudatus Caesare? si quis

Opprobriis dignum latraverit, integer ipse? 85
‘Solventur risu tabulae, tu missus abibis!

verses 1-16. ‘insnum my friends, to a lecture on plain living '-ir is not Horace
speaking, but Ofellus-a plain man, but a philosopher in his way-‘ listen,
but not ina smartly laid out dining-room nor when your bellies are full. Go
and hunt, or break a rough horse, or (if you are only frt for such effeminate
exercisa) haren good game of ball or quoit‚ and then 1 defy you to despise
plain fare. ’

16-22. Hunger is thebert sance. The rarest delicacies lose their flavour if appetite
is wanting.

²¹·30· It is, 1 suppose, useless to protest against the preference of a peacoclr to
a barndoor fowl. It is more costly and appeals to the eye. Even that is
ridiculous, for you are not going to eat the smart feathers. But your fancies
about food go further still

³1-39· You think you know whether the pike is caught in the river or in the sea.
Yon like your mullet large (though you must divide it to eat it) and your pike
small. Your only principle is to take what is rare and avoid what is natural.
That comcs from not kuowing what it is to be really hungry.

3944 Yon say you like to gloat over the big dishfull. One is inclined to call
the south wind to taint the glutton's dainties; but there is no need: boar and
turbot lose all their savonr when the stomach is tired; theu you prefer

44-52. Prinoes and peasants share the taste for egga and olives. The fact is
that it ia greatly a matter of fashiou. The nastiest dish can be made the
ungue

53-69. There lan great distinction in my judgrnent between plain living and mean
living, forthere are fanlts on both sides. You need not be like Avidienns.
