TO THE SATIRES. 9

upon himself. He would escape more and more into the back·
ground and let others seem to speak. He is an interested, amused,
hearer and learner‚ not a Stoic‚ nor even an Epicurean, dogmatist.

No one intersered with his patent to the title. Persius, who, even
when in his Stoie iervour he departs furthest from Horace’s spirit,
copies his torm most closely, gives no name to his own composition.
Juvenal, to whom there are no uncertainties, no lights and shades
in his confident and rutbless declamation‚ returned to the name of
Satirest

§ 6. Petronal names in the Satires.

If the Satires are imitations of conversation, they have naturally
a personal element. Conversation starts from persons and incidents,
it prefers concrete instantes to abstract descriptions, aflavour of inno·
cent malice is not out of place in it, its greatest adornment is the art
ol telling storics vividly and at the happy moment. As a whole it
. must bc allowed that Horace's writing bas this effect in a singular
degree alter the lapse of nineteen centuries. Even if Nomentanus
and Opimius had no lise outside his verses, he gives them lise enough
sorbis purpose. The interest ol going behind what he bas toldus
and seeing how far his characters can be identified with particular
persons historically known, lies not so much in any gain oi point to
« the Satire that may be loolred fon-the persons are too obscure, as well
as the results too uncertain, sor that—but in the light which it may
throw on the methods oi the poet, on his personal motives, and on
his relations to his contemporaries.

The Scholiasts are prepared in most cases to tell us who each per·
son named is. They had access to earlier sources of information ²,
and no doubt in some cases they have preserved lor us a true tradi-
tion. But they evidently blunder. They differ from one another,
showing that the tradition itself was unsettled They betray that they
are merely paraphrasing the context, sometimes the context mis-
understood. They are not trustworthy on the question on which they
had the greatest advantage over us, viz. the question whether a name
is borrowed or not from some earlier writer. An instance which
