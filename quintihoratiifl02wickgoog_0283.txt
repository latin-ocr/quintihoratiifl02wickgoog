278 HORATII EPISTULARUM

Quinque bonos solitum Variam dimittere patres,
Certemus spinas animone ego fortius an tu
Evellas agro, et melior sit Horatius an res.

Me quamvis Lamiae pietas et cura moratur
Fratrem maerentis, rapto de fratre dolentis
Insolabiliter, tamen istuc mens animusque

Fert et amat spatiis obstantia rumpere claustra.
