SATIRE 111.

DAMASIPPUS, OR A Man WORLD.

Tmo Satire is based ou the Stoic paradox that every one but the wise man is
mad (ὅτι aris ἄφρων μαίνεται, see Cioero's 4th Parador), which Horace treats aster
his wont‚ ianghing with others at it, but using it as a weapou with which, without
departing irom his habituai irony, he can strilre at practicai iollies.

The bnlk oi the Satire is put into the mouth oi Stertinius, a iecturer oi the day
(hire Crispinus oi Book 1), whom in Epp. 1. rr. ao Horace, males, but in a ban·
tering tone, the representative of Stoic philosophy. He is otherwise unknown to uu.
'ihe Scholiasta say his works filled rao volumes.

Damasippus (like Trebatius in Sat r. 1) is a character in Cicero's Epistleu, in
which he appears as a elever gobetween in the purchase oi estates and works oi
art (Cic. ad Att. 12. ²9 and 33, ad Fam. 7. ²33 cp. vv. 20-26 oi thia Satire).
Horace representa him (whether with any historical foundation or not, we annot
say) as having been ruined audon ibe point oi suicide. Stertinius meets him on
the Pons Fabricius and sareu him irom this ioliy by preaching to him the Stoic
doctrine that all men aare the true philosopher are mad aliire-he need not be
ashamed; let his misiortunes beas ridiculons and his conduct aa ioolish as possible,
he has eli He world as companions in his ioiiy. This isset outat length ina
discourse which, as is usual with Horaoe, loses aiter a time its vitai connection
with the scene. The dramatic tone ir rernmed at v. 296, and Horace ends me
Satire by good-humonredly turning the iaugh against himself.

This Satire should be compared throughout with Sat. a. 7, which deols in a
similar way with another Paradox.

Veraes 1-16. Damasippus rallies Horace ior his lastidiousness and laziness in com-
16-11ills‘1ldlrhelient advice,' says Horace, ‘my philosopher. How do you know me
ao well i'
