οη the other hand, in Epist 20, where Horace is apparently in·
tending to date the Book as well as his own life, he says that he
completed his forty-fourth December (the mouth os his birth) in
the year when Lollius was consul. This was in ac. ar. It is
a natural mode os dating is it means ‘last December '-a less
natural one if another birthday has already passed. We are driven
therefore to choose between supposing that Agrippa achieved his
victory over the Cantabri or some parts of it in u. e. 20, in spite of
Dion Cassius' words, or that Horace's desire to linlr Lollius’ name
with the conclusion of his book has led him to date it by the year
before the one last expired.

Title and natm of tlte Epistles.

Horace once uses the word ‘Epistula' in Epp. 2. 2. 22, possibly,
but not certainly, in the sense of a poetical epistle. In Epp. 2. 1.
250 he seems to include the Epistles of the First Book with the
Satires under the common title ot' ‘Sermones ¹.' Otherwise we have
no direct evidence what title he intended them to bear. The
MSS. all call them ‘Epistulae’ and the Scholiasts say that the title
was given to them by Horace himself.

They are ‘Epistulae’ in varying senses. Some have not only the
form, but a definite purpose at the moment and such as finds
natural expression in a letter—enquiries about absent friends, as in
Ep. 33 an invitation, as in Ep. 53 the introduction os a sriend, as
in Ep. 9; desire sor insonnation about awatering-placc, as in Ep. 15.
To these we may add, as short and purely personal in their tone,
Epp. 4, 8 and 12. It is hard again to draw a fixed line between
these and such Epistles as 7, 10 and 11, where, though a larger
and general subject is in view, the person addressed and the oc·
casion are never wholly lost. But the epistolary introduction and
conclusion tend by degrees to become merely an excuse lor the
moralizing which intervenes, till, as in Epp. 1 ando, the only relic
leit of the letter is the vocative case which begins it, just ns ‘Qui
lit, Maecenasr’ or ‘Vel quia, Maecenas,' begins a Satire. It is of
course possible to underrate the persona] clement which is really

¹'l'hey are probably also included is said that Augustus ‘post Sermones
in thetirle ‘Sermones’ in theSuetonian lectos· complained that none was ad-
lile ol Horace (volt. p. xxix). where it dressed to hun.
