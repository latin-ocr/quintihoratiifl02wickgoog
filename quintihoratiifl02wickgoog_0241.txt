236 HORATll EPISTULARUM

Curantem quicquid dignuin sapiente bonoque est? t
Non tu corpus eras sine pectore. Di tibi sormam,

Di tibi divitias dederunt artemque fruendi.

Gratia, sama, valetudo contingat abunde,

Et mundus victus non deficiente crumena?

Inter spem curamque, timores inter ct iras,

Omnem crede diem tibi diluxisse supremum:

Grata superveniet quae non sperabitur liora.

Me pinguem et nitidum bene curata cute vises ¹5
Cum ridere voles Epicuri de grege porcum.
