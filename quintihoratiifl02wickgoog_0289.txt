284 HORATII EPISTULARUM

Dicet eques; sed equi frenato est auris in ore).
Maior utrum populum frumenti copia pascat;
Collectosne bibant imbres puteosne perennes
iugis aquae, (nam vina nihil moror illius orae;
Rure meo possum quidvis perferre patique;

Ad mare cum veui, generosum et lene requiro,
Quod curas abigat, quod cum spe divite manet

In venas animumque meum, quod verba ministret, 20
Quod me Lucanae iuvenem commendet amicae).
Tractus uter plures lepores, uter educet apros,
Utra magis pisces et echinos aequora celent,
Pinguis ut inde domum possim Phaeaxque reverti,
Scribere te nobis, tibi nos accredere par est.
Maenius, ut rebus maternis atque paternis
