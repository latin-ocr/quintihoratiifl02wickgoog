248 HORATlI EPISTULARUM

The story oi Philippus end Volteius gives a picture to be contrasted with that
oi Maecenas and Horace. It is patronage based on uo intellectual sympatby
or real benevolence, but on caprice and a selfish desire ior amusement. It has
the effect sor the time oi breaking down the sturdy independence and destroying
the contented simplicity os Volteius. It puts him into two salse posilious—first
as guest at a table where he does not understand the proprieties, then iu a
country liie ior which he has no taste or aptitude.

The story is cleverly imitated, in its outward aspect, hy Swiit in his ‘Address
to the Earl oi Oxiord,' though a different turn is given to it; his own hanishment
to the deanery oi St. Patrick’s being the analogue to Volteius' settlemcnt in a

Sabine sarm.

QUINQUE dies tibi pollicitus me rure futurum,
Sextilem totum mendax desideror. Atqui,

Si me vivere vis sanum recteque valentem,
Quam mihi das aegro, dahis aegrotare timenti,
Maecenas, veniam, dum ficus prima calorque
Dissignatorem decorat lictoribus atris,

Dum pueris omnis pater et matercula pallet,
Officiosaque sedulitas et opella sorensis
Adducit febres et testamenta resignat.

Quodsi bruma nives Albanis illinet agris,

Ad mare descendet vates tuus et sibi parcet
Contractusque leget: te, dulcis amice, reviset
