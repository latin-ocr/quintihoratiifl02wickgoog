96-112. But through it all do notlose sight of the true ends of life. Thinlr whether
after all the peace of a private life is not the happiest thing. Think of me in
my Sabine valley with my books, my modest competente, and my contented
mind.

On the general subject of the Epistie and its relation to Ep. 17 see the intro·
duction to that Epistle. The subject of a dependent's behnviour is continued, but
in a different vein ς this time in a letter which has, in part at least, close relations to
the circumstances of Lollius. lt is not a needy man making up to a patron fora
dinner and for the heneht of his relations (ls'p. 17. nri, but a man born in good
position. The Epistle speaks (vv. 60-64) of his father's estate, and he is probably
the Lollius of Ep. 1, and theson of the Lollius who was consul in uc, 11 (Ep.
1ο. 18). He is thought of as entering the friendship not of some merely rich

. patron, but ofa ‘potens amicus,’aman high in the political world, with secrets of ..

importunae which his protlgl must respect aud keep (vv. 37, 38 and 68-70). The
Epistle, however, is not free from difficulties. The dangers against which Lollius
is wumed in vv. 21-36 and 72-75 seem ill suited to the kind of character pre-
sumed in the rest of the poem; and, taking the Epistle as a whole, and supposing
that Lollius had really attached himself to some one of high position in the Court
circle, it is not easy to believe that its immediate publication can have been agree·
able either to patron or prrtlgl. This last supposition, however, is not necessary.
The conditions of the cnse are satisfied if Lollius, a young literary friend of the
poet, was contemplating the acceptance of such an office ns that which Augustus
himself offered to Horace, or that which Celsus holds in Ep. 8; and if Horace
wrote to him, perhaps nt his request, sketcbing the duties and dangers of a private
secretary in a great house. Pnrt of the lecture mny have been evidently playful,
and the issue of the Epistle may have been that Lollius declined the office.

lt isto be noticed that any disrespect to Lollius is out of the question, supposing
him to be the person we imagine. It seems also that the Epistie was written in
11. e. 1ο (see on v. 56 aud introd. to the Epistles, p. 207), and published therefore
within a few mouths.
