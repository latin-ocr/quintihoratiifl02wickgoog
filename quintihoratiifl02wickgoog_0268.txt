LIB. Ι. EPIST. 10. 263

Sic qui pauperiem veritus potiore metallis

Libertate caret, dominum vehit improbus atque 40
Serviet aeternum, quia parvo nesciet uti.

Cui non conveniet suares, ut calceus olim,

Si pede maior erit subvertet, si minor uret.

Laetus sorte tua vives sapienter, Aristi,

Nec me dimittes incastigatum ubi plura

Cogere quam satis est ac non cessare videbor.

Imperat aut servit collecta pecunia cuique,

Tortum digna sequi potius quam ducere funem.

Haec tibi dictabam post fanum putre Vacunae,

Excepto quod non simul esses cetera laetus. 50
