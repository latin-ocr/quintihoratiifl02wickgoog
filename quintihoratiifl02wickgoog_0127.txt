120 HORATII SATIRARUM

There is a medium between lo'olring aiter things too sharply 'aud not loolrin'g
after them at all.

70-81. Now hear the advantsges of plain living. First, it means good digestim,
and with good digestiou comcs a free aud active mind. ἲ

81-88. Next, it leaves a margin for improvement; for holldaya or when health
requires lt. Luxnry has used up all its resourcea.

89-99. In the good old days delioacies were always reserved for hospitallty.
Gluttouy leads even now to disgraoe aa well as to ruinous ansvagance.

99·1¹¹· Do you answer that there is uo fear of rulu in your cuse; that you have
enough to spend ou your gluttonyf I answer that there are better uses of
money. Relieve the poor, restore tempies, give to your country. But have
you immunity from human chauces? And if change come, who iahest fitted

proprietor where now he pays rent aud works hard. 110 lived plainly theu,

his sons to do the same.

The lecture (verses 1-111) ls pretty clearly meant to be put into the mouth of
Ofellus, who is described as au old neighbour of Horace's, and as a representative
of the sturdy independenoe and strong senae of hls fellow countrymeu the ‘pernix
Apnlns' (Epod. u. 41), ‘Sabellus' (Sat. 1. 1. 36; Epp. 1. 16. 49), etc. The
purpose of the lecture suita the character, but, as in those of Stertinius in Sat.
aa and Davus in Sat a. 7, there is little or uo attempt to make the style or
topica iu detail correspond to the speaker. It is a satire, auch aa in the First
Book would have been in Horaoe's owu'rnouth, ou the luxury aud caprices of
the day.

It will be noticed (see on v. 114) that Ofellus is supposed to have been dis-
poascssed of his property at the same time as Horace himself, via in lae. 41,
and to have lived on as a tenant under Umbrenus (v. 133), the veterun to whom

the land had been assigned. Whether he is supposed to he alive still does not

general idea of treatment from Lucilius, who, according to Cicero, de Fin. 2.

fragments of it quoted by Cicero ia referred to in v. 4⁶3 see note there.
