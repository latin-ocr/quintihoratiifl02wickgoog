alo GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO

which Horace felt both in respect of form and matter from the
philosophical dialogues of Cicero. It cannot be doubted that his
Epistles in the same way are influenced by Cicero's Letters.

The differences between the Epistles and Satires are analogous to
the differences between the later Satires and the earlier.

Liie is passing on and has brought to him, is not strong health‚
the means of taking care of himself, ease, interests, and content·
ment. He spends his autumn in the Sabine valley, his winter by the
sea, returns to Rome with the swallows‚ and stays there only as
long as he feels disposed. His acquaintance among the congenial
part of Roman society has grown. He has a recognised position
as a man oi letters. There are still critics who in public decry his
Odes and Epodes‚ but they read and admire them in private, and
they pay him the flattery of soolish imitation. He has no real
disposition to quarrel with thern. We sechim in one light which
is always an amiable one. His correspondents are greatly among
the younger generation of literary men. He is interested in their
worlr, he has their confidence, and can speak at once honestly and
hindly with no salse affectation either of superiority or ol equality.

Is his wiews oi lite are richer and more mature than in the Satires,
his expression oi thern is more perfect. We feel the training ol the
seven years given to lyric composition. There is more case and
music in the verse—more touches of imagination in the language.
He has reached the perfectiori oi his own style and the most
finished grace oi which Latin writing is capable.

Order of the Epistles.

It has been already pointed out (vol. r. p. 8) how exactly the
arrangement os the Epistles in this Boolr corresponds in one im-
portant particular with that of the Odes of the first three Books-
the first Epistle and the last but one being addressed, as Ode 1. 1 and
a. 29, to Maecenas, the last place in each case being rescrved for
the poet's own pride at the accomplishment of his taslr. We may
trace occasionally in the order of the rest of the Epistles some oi
the same principles which seemed to dictate the order oi the Odes
and, in a less marked degree, ol the Satires. Ep. 2 seems to follow
Ep. 1 as an immediate putting into practice ol the purposes an-
nounced in it. Epp.17,18 are put together as dealing with one
‚subject in a way that might be less easily perceived if they were
apart, at the same time the two are put at some distance from Ep. 6,
