GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE
SATIRES.

§n Drirr'sion eff tlte two Books.

Iu may be taken sor certain that the division oi the two Books oi
Satires is a real and chronological division, not merely, like that oi
the first three books of the Odes, the division sor artistic purposes of
acollection given to the world together. Such a real division is indi·
cated by the very definite epilogue with which the First Book is
concluded and the prologue with which the Second Book opens. No
doubt something of this effect is given by the placing os Od. 2. 20
and 3. r, and in a slighter way still by that oi Od. 1. 37, 38 and
2. 1 ; but in the case of the Odes there is no mistake when we come
to Od 3. 30 and compare it with r. 1, that we have in them the true
prologue and epilogue to the work as a whole. To make the parallel
effective, Book 11'0r the Satires should have an epilogue which
would mark not only the close of a Book but the achievement of a
full purpose. Sat. 11 is ended in a manner suitable to the more
dramatic character of the Book, not by a conscious epilogue,
but by a sketch lighter in tone than the two which precede
it, and one which gathers up and puts in more dramatic form
some os the chief topics ol the book and especially oi its earlier
’ part. Amongst Horace’s collections of poenis it is analogous to the
conclusion oi the Epodes and oi the IVth Book os the Odes, not to
that os Sat. I, Odes I-III‚ or Epp. I. He has his two manners,
evidently, os ending a Book: but this does not render it more prob
able that he should have published the two Books os Satires
together and ended the first with ‘ 1 puer, atque meo citus haec sub
scribe libello‚' and the second with ‘velut illis Canidia afflasset
peior serpentibus Afris!

But in truth the two Books stand apart from one another widely,
both in general torm and topics, and also in tone personal and
