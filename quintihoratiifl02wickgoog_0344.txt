TO AUGUSTUS.

A deseme os tite Classical Sclool of latin Poetry.

Verses 1-4. ilou are so busy, with the Roman world on yonr shoulders‚ Caesar,
that anything I write to you mnst be short.

5-17. Like the demigods in your tastes, you are unlike them ia this, that men have
recognized you ior what yon are in your liietime.

18-27. But your countrymen, though they do this justice to yon, are incapable
generally oi doing justice to contemporaries, irom their excessive regard
ior the ancients Every rag ol primitive Latinity is treated as an atterance
oi the Mases.

²8-33- If it be pieaded that oi Greek poets the oldest are the best, the aasweris
plain: ‘Are we the Greeksl’

34-49. ii it be said that generally poems, like wine, improve by time, the answer
is: Time is a relative phrase. Where will you draw the line between ancient
and moderni

50-62. There is a mge ior the ancients We know by heart all the cant epithets
ior Ennius and Naevius, Pacuvius and Accium in comedy it is Airaaius,
Plautus, Caecilius, Terence. This is the orthodox list.

63-68. The admiration is too indiscriminate.

neither do i accept him as a perfect model.

76-85. Ido not like to see moderns mn down merely because they are modern,
and ail criticism oi ancients treated as proianity.

86-89. This praise ol antiqnity is inspired by jeaiousy oi contemporaries.

90-92. it is lncky ior ns that the Greeks had no such dislike oi novelty, else we
should not have had the magarine which we haye.

93-102. The first use they put their leisnre to was to essay first one art, then
another, with the irenhness and the inconstancy oi a child.

103-107. At Rome we were more serious: domestic dntiea, morale, (and a little
money-getting, occupied oar countrymen in old days.

old, fit and unfit.

118-138. Weil, there is something to be said aiter all ior poetry. There are
worse madnesses. It has even its uses, in education, as a practical teacher
oi philosophy, in religion.
