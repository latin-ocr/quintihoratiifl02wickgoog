HORATII ARS POETlCA. 429

Nullum ultra verbnm aut operam insumebat inanem

Quin sine rivali teque et tua solus amares

Vir bonus et prudens versus reprehendet inertes, 445

Ornamenta, parum claris lucem dare coget,

Arguat ambigue dictum, mutanda notabit,

Offendam in nugisi¹ Hae nugae seria ducent
