He supposes himself interrupted (v. 19) with the question ‘ Have you no nutu
oi your ownl’

Vu. 20-28. 1 pretend, he answers, to uo infallibiilty. That is the vice oi the
censorious in private iiie. They ure blind to their own iaults, keen oi sight
to their neighbours

29-37. Little faults oi temper or manner or dress overshadow sterling merits
