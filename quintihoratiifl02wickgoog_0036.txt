LIB. 1. SAT. t.

Suscitet ac gnatis reddat carisque propinquis!
Non uxor salvum te volt, non filius3 omnes
Vicini oderunt, noti, pueri atque puellae.
Miraris, quum tu argento post omnia ponas,

Si nemo praestet quem non merearis amorem?
An si cognatos, nullo natura labore

Quos tibi dat, retinere velis servareque amicos,
Infelix operam perdas, ut si quis asellum

ln Campo doceat parentem currere irenis?
Denique sit finis quaerendi, cumque habeas plus
