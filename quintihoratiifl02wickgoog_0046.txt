The musicisn Tigellius oi this Satine (vv. 3-19) and nithe last (vv. 1-4) is iden·
tified with the Tigellius oi Cicero's letters (nd Att. 13. 49. 50, and 51, ad Fam.
7. 14), 111 was the nephew (or grandson) oi Phamea (named in these letters
and ad Aet. 9. 93 9. 13, and ad Fam. 9. 16), 1 rich ireedmnu from Sardinia.
He had quarrelled with Cicero because he thought him slsch 1111111101
Phamea's which the great orator had undertakes, but was prerented irom pleadlug
by the sect that the case oi P. Sestius 111111 on the same day. We gather irom
the letters thet he was a iavourite oi the dictator Caesar. Cicero speaks (to
Gallus ad Fam. 7. 14) with contempt oi his Sardinian origin, ‘hominem pestilenti·
orem patriasua' ‘Habes Sardos venales: alium aliouequiorem.’ He calls him
‘salaconem’ (σαλάκανα), ‘a swaggerer,' and speaks oi him as ‘addictum Calvi
Licinii Hipponacteo praeconio! Porph. (on this Sat. v. 1) has preserved a line
oi that impona, ‘Sardi Tigelli putidum caput venit)

The Scholiasts identiiy him with the ‘Hermogenes Tigellius’ oi 1. 4 71, 1.
10. 80, the ⁴ Hermogenes' oi v. 129 oi this Sutire and oi 1. 9. 25, 1. to. 18, and the
‘Tigellius' oi Set. 1. 10. 90. It seems clear however that this was another and a
younger person. The Tigellius 01811. 1. 1. 3 and 1. 3. 4 is already dead. The
Hermogenes Tigellius oi 1. 4. 71 and 1. to. 80 is still alive, although Sat 1. 4
contains internui evidence oi having been composed later than Sat 1. 1 (cp. 1. 1.
17111111. 4. 92), and Sat. 1. 10 oi having been composed 1111111111 Sat. 1. 4
(see 1. 4. 11 and 1. 10. 50). We may add that whereas the elder Tigellius was
lampooned by Calvus, Hermogenes Tigellius in Sat 1. 10. 19 is said to sing
Calvus’s songs.
