402 HORATlI ARS POETICA.

Interpres, nec desilies imitator in arctum

Unde pedem proferre pudor vetet aut operis lex. ¹35
Nec sic incipies ut scriptor cyclicus olim:

‘Fortunam Priami cantabo et nobile bellum.'

Quid dignum tanto seret hic promissor hiatu?

Parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.

Quanto rectius hic qui nil molitur inepte: 140
‘Dic mihi, Musa, virum captae post tempora Troiae

Qui mores hominum multorum vidit et urbes'

Non sumum ex fulgore, sed extumo dare lucem

Cogitat, ut speciosa dehinc miracula promat,

Antiphaten Scyllamque et cum Cyclope Charybdin. ¹4⁵
