INTRODUCTION TO THE
ARS POETICA.

ΟΝ the difficult questions of the date of the ‘Epistula ad Pisones,’
of the persons to whom it was addressed‚ and of its relation to
Horace’s other writings, what I had to say has been said in the general
Introduction to the three larger and literary Epistles‚ pp. 331 f.
As was there noticed the earliest titles by which we find it called
are ‘Ars Poetica¹' and ‘Liber de Arte Poetica' by both of which
names it is quoted by Quintilian. These were natural titles to be
given to it by those who were already using itas a school-book
which served the double purpose of a master-piece of literature and
a manual of literary knowledge. They serve also well to characterize
a poem of which the chief doctrine is that poetry is an art and
must be treated as an art: but we may feel pretty sure that Horace,
who shrank so sensitively from anything like pretension or pedantry,
would not have given any sanction to such a title. In any case it
is, as it was also called in early times ¹, an Epistle, not a treatise in
verse (like ‘ L'Art Poetique' of Boileau), but a letter inverse, withan
immediate and personal as well as a literary purpose.

The address to the Pisones, father and sons, is not conventional or
complimentary, but has a vital relation to the course of the poem.
The appellations change and take colour from the context: ‘Pisones'
‘pater et nati patre digni,’ ‘0 Pompilius sanguis! The places
where a name or other personal appeal occurs are always either where
the chief points of the Epistle are to be enforced, as the necessity of
unity in conception (v. 6), the danger of laziness in Roman poets
(v. 291), the valuelessness of mediocre poetry (v. 360), or where
Horace is evidently sweetening, after his wont, advice which he
wishes to press (as in v. 22), or where there are other indicatione
that some definite purpose, conceived or imagined, is in view (as in
