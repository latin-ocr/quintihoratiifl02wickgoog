304 HORATII EPISTULARUM

‘Et mihil' Dividuo findetur munere quadra.
Sed tacitus pasci si posset corvus, haberet

Plus dapis et rixae multo minus invidiaeque.
Brundisium comes aut Surrentum ductus amoenum,
Qui queritur salebras et acerbum frigus et imbres,
Aut cistam effractam et subducta viatica plorat,
Nota refert meretricis acumina, saepe catellam,
Saepe periscelidem raptam sibi flentis, uti mox
Nulla fides damnis verisque doloribus adsit.

Nec semel irrisus triviis attollere curat

Fracto crure planum, licet illi plurima manet
Lacrima, per sanctum iuratus dicat Osirim:
‘Credite non ludo; crudeles, tollite claudum'
‘Quaere peregrinum,' vicinia rauca reclamat.
