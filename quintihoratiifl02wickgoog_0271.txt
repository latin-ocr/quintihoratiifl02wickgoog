266 HORATII EPISTULARUM

Frigus collegit, fumos et balnea laudat

Ut fortunatam plene praestantia vitam.

Nec si te validus iactaverit Auster iu alto,

Incolumi Rhodos et Mytilene pulchra lacit quod
Paenula solstitio, campestre nivalibus auris,

Per brumam Tiberis, Sextili mense caminus.

Dum licet ac voltum servat Fortuna benignum, ιο
Romae laudetur Samos et Chios et Rhodos absens.
Tu quamcunque deus tibi fortunaverit horam

Grata sume manu, neu dulcia differ in annum,
