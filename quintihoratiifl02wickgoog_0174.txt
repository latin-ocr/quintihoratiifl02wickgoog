SATIRE V.

TIRESIAS, OR LEGACY·HUNTING.

Tuis practice is touched in passing in Epp. 1. r. 77. It is described in Cicero,
Pnradox 5. a ‘An eorum servitus dubia est, qui cupiditate peculii nnllam con·
ditionem recusant durissimae servitutis? Hereditatis spes quid iniquitatis in ser·
ciendo non suscipit? quem nutum locupletis orbi senis nou observat? Loquitur
ad voluntatem: quidquid denunciatum sit, lacit: assectatur, assidet, muneratur.'
The ‘orbitas‘ which was the temptation to it belongs to that disinclinatiou to
marriage and its responsibilitles which was a marked feature oi Roman lit'e. See
notes on Od. 4. 7. 19, C. S. 18-20.

The satirical description of the arts oi a ‘captator' (v. 57) is thrown into the
form os a burlesque continuation os the dialogus between Ulysses aud the shade oi
Tiresias in Odyss. 11.

It starts with Tiresias’ prophecy in v. 114 soll.

ὀψὲ reads νεῖαι ὀλέσας diro τάντατ ἑταίρους,
νηὸς lr’ ἀλλοτρίης· δήεις δ’ ἐν πήματα οἴκῳ
ἄνδρας ὑπερφιάλους οἵ τοι βίοτον κατέδουσι.
