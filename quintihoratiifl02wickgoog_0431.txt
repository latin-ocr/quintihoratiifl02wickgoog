426 HORATII ARS POETICA.

Concubitu prohibere vago, dare iura maritis,

Oppida moliri, leges incidere ligno.

Sic honor et nomen divinis vatibus atque

Carminibus venit. Post hos insignis Homerus

Tyrtaeusque mares animos in Martia bella,

Versibus exacuit; dictae per carmina sortes;

Et vitae monstrata via est3 et gratia regum

Pieriis temptata modis3 ludusque repertus

Et longorum operum finis: ne sorte pudori

Sit tibi Musa lyrae sollers et cantor Apollo.

Natura fieret laudabile carmen an arte

Quaesitum est: ego nec studium sine divite vena

Nec rude quid prosit video ingenium alterius sic 410
Altera poscit opem res et coniurat amice.

Qui studet optatam cursu contingere metam

Multa tulit fecitque puer, sudavit et alsit,

Abstinuit Venere et vino: qui Pythia cantat

Tibicen, didicit prius extimuitque magistrum. 4¹5
