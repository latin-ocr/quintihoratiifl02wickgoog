NOTE ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SITE OF HORACE’S ‘VILLA.’ 297

of one wh0, as we leam, was worshipped at Reate and who, as Acron
tells us from Varro, was according to one view identified with the
Roman ‘Victoria' Of the other names which we have in Horace
‘Ustica cubans’ (od. 1. 17. 11) possibly still survives in the name
La Rustica, said to be given to some part of the valley 3 but peasants
are so willing to recognize names which travellers suggest that
such discoveries are to be received with cantion. Two names are
given of hills or foresta ‘Lucretilis’ Od. 1. 17. 1, ‘Haedilia¹ ibid. 9.
The latter has left no discoverable trace. The former is possibly
found in an altered form in the Liber Pontificalis, in a record of
a donatiou by the Emperor Constantine to a church on the via
labicana, where an estate is described as ‘possessio in territorio
Sabinensi quae cognominatur “ad duas Casas '’ submonte Lucretio!
The name ‘ad duas Casas' is supposed to survive in the chapel of
the Madonna della Casa on the hill side beyond Rocca Giovane,
The Mons Lucretius or Lucretilis will be the high ground behind it,
but it still may be either some minor point immediately at its back
or the whole mass of hills between the valley and the Campagna‚
of which the highest point is called in some maps Gennaro, in
others Monte Zappi. This point is 4165 English feet above the
sea, and is visible to a great distance. The nearer tops are from
600 to 800 feet lower. When the valley was identified, about the
middle of the 18th century ¹, the site selected as that of Horace's
villa was that marked A in the annexed plan. There are some
remains of an ancient dwelling-house, ‘a scattered fragment or
two of columns of travertine or a small piece of mosaic,' and itis
said that the floors of six chambers were uncovered‚ but covered
again with the earth, as nothing of value was found ². All sub
sequent visitors and topographers took this for the site till the
question was reopened (185 5) by M. Noel des Vergers and Cavaliere
Rosa, the Roman explorer, who examined the valley together and
put forward the claims of a rival site (that marked B) just behind
Rocca Giovane, where some terraciug is noticed. Their arguments
for this situation are (ι) that it answers more exactly the description
of ‘post fanum putre Vacunae) But any place higher up the valley
than the temple might fairly be so described, especially as the pur·
pose of the expression is pretty certainly not topographical, but
humorous, being equivalent to ‘in holiday land’ (see note on Epp.

¹Thc arguments for the valleyand de Sanctis, 1761, and by the abbe
the special site are given in books Capmartindeuqhaupy 1769.
