’ ’ ΤΟ ΤΗΕ SATIRES. ¹3

again a spendthrist, and in the second passage 02 21222 Satire a
dramatic picture is given of his way of inviting the purveyors cf
luxury and vice to help him dispose of his fortune In 2. 8 he is
one of Nasidienus' two ‘scurrae’ the other being ‘Porcius' We
notice there that Nasidienus is evidently a disguised name, if not an
invented character, and it is necessary therefore that though the guests
are real persons the ‘scurrae’ of the host should have fictitious
names. That of Porcius can hardly but be explained by ‘ Ridiculus
totas simul absorbere placentas' 02 his greedy mode of eating.
Nomentanus is therefore, as elsewhere, a typieal not apersonal narne.
Now Nomentanus occurs in two fragments of Lucilius (2. 6. and 8) as
the name of a man whom he is exposing and to whom he wishes ill.
Yet the Schol. explains the name in Horace 02 one L. Cassius Nomen-
tanus, who spent 7,0co,000 sesterces cn his gluttcny, and whose cook
Dama was hired by Sallustius Crispus. Even if there was such a
person, we may yet think it probable that Horace was thinking, not
of him, but of the Lucilian Nomentanus.

Horace refers from time to tirne 20 characters and scenes of
Terence (2. 2. 20, 2. 3. 262 f), and there is one reference which the
Scholiast on A. P. 2 37 points out to a play cf Caecilius¹. But for his
purpose the nrimes and ‘togatae¹' would be still more appropriate,
and that there are references tc these in his writings can hardly be
doubted.

It should be noticed that the literary use of names from the pcets
is quite in accordance with his way 02 using the prose author whom
he knew best. ‘A doctor' in Sat. 2. 3. 161 is ‘Craterus' the doctor
of Cic ad Art. 12. 13 and 14. The names that supply the dramatic
framework cf Sat. 2. 2, and 3, and probably4, are from Cicero's letters.
lt is analogous also to his use of Greek stories (as of Polemon in 2.
3. 254) and of Homeric and tragic personages (2. 3. 132 f. and
187 f.)³.

It has been often pointed out that some cf Horace's names are
adapted etymologically to the characters they indicate. That in
inventing names he should employ this device is natural. It has
been a device of satirists and allegorists in all ages, and he has
