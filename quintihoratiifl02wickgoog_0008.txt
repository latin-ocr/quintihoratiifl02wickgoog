PREFACE TO VOLUME ΙΙ.

—4—

Ι aava to express to the Delegates of the Press
and to the kind purchasers ol the first volume of this
edition my regret sor the 'long but unavoidable delay
which has intervened in the completion of the work.
That it is completed now Ι owe to the unstinted and
unselfish help os my friend Mr. A. Ο. Prickard‚ F ellow
of New College. Ι desired at one time that the
volume should appear in our joint names and had
obtained the sanction of the Delegates to this arrange-
ment; but we found the difficulties of joint work
too great, in view of the impossibility of our being
much together; and therefore, although a first drast
of the notes on the later Epistles was prepared by

hlr. Prickard‚ Ι have ultimately rewritten these, and

made mysels responsible for the whole. At the same
time Ι cannot overstate the help which Ι have received
from him in this part ol the volume, and indeed in
suggestions and criticisms upon the whole of it.

With respect to the text Ι have little to add to
what Ι wrote, Ι hope with proper modesty, in the
introduction to Vol. I. Keller's ‘Epilegomena,’ pub-
lished in 1879--1880,Ι has added to the obligation
which he and his colleague have laid upon all students
