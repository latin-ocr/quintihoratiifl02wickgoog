10 GENERAL INTRODUCTION

seems to combine several of these defects is to be found in their notes
on the ‘causa Petilli' a cause cc'llbre of the time, or one still remem-
bered, to which Horace alludes in Sat. 1. 4. 94, and again in r. 10.
26. In the first passage he gives him the fuller name of Petillius
Capitolinus, and speaks of the charge brought against him as that oi
theft, and of his having been acquitted. The Scholiasta write of this
as with perfect knowledge, and say that Petillius was a friend of
Augustus, who had charge os the Capitol, and was accused of having
stolen the crown of Jupiter, but was acquittcd by favour of Caesar. It
has been pointed out however, as'conclusively discrediting this story,
(1) that a coin has been found with a temple on the obverse and the
inscription Petillius Capitolinus, which seems to show that Capitolinus
was a cognomen of the gens Petillia, and traccd by them to some

honourable origin; (a) that the crime of robbing Capitoline Jove of '

his crown was proverbial as early as Plautus: see Trin. 1. 2. 46,
Menaechm. 5. 5. 38.

It has been already suggested that in looking for real names a dis-
tinction is probably to be drawn between Horace’s earlier Satires
(represented chiefly by Sat. 1. 3) and the later ones. ln the greater
part of them his purpose was general. He was assailing fodies, not
gibbeting individuals ¹, and we have no indications or traditionsos his
having ventod personal dislikes by making his enemies ‘slide into

verse and hitch . . in a ¹rhyme.’ At the same time he ensorces his ,

lessons by anecdotes, and sums up classes in individual names. He
even justifies the method humorously by tracing it to the example of
his good father, who taught him morals in a concrete shape, not by
describing the character he was to aim at or avoid, but by pointing,
as they passed in the street, -to one and another as models or warn-
ings (Sat. 1. 4. ¹05 i). There are many cases in which we can
imagine no motive for reticence, and in which the particularity oi
designation would lose all point if the particulare were not real.
