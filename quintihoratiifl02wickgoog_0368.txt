fastidious seli-criticism that it involves, he seems to be describing‚ and in glowing
and sympathctic words, the methods and achievemeuts oi his friend, whether
recently dead or still alive-the poet Virgil. Thon again an ironical passage.
‘The world sees in such a poet how easily and smoothly his verses flow, and little
thinks oi the agony which they have eost the composer. But aiter all isn't it better
to ba able contentedly to write bad verses! But,' and here finally he becomes

serious, ‘my true reason is that my mind is tull oi lise and its problems. ls not

The Epistle will naturally be compared—

1. With Epp. 1. 1, which handles the same theme. lt will be noticed that
any arguments ior a later date ior this Epistle, based on its language about the
poet's advancing years (vv. 55 i.) are answered betorehancl by the parallel ‘solve
senescentem' oi Epp. 1. 1. 8. What he says herc is very greatly an expanding ot
the ‘non eadem est aetas, non mens' os that Epistle. The change lies (1) in the
fuller space given to the arguments againsta retum to his old pursuit ; which
means probably (as has been saidl that the question was sor some reason. catemal
or internal, becomiug a more pressing one to him: (a) iu the greater mellowness
and confidence with which he sets forth the philosophy ol lile to which he has
attained.

2. With Epp. 1. 3. It is one oi two instances, besides those addressed to
Maecenas, oi a second Epistle to the same person; and it is interesting as illus·
trating the reality ot' the personal element even in the more general Epistles‚ to
trace thc identity oi the line taken towards Floms in the two. It is iu both, the
young man oi letters, to whom Horace speaks naturally and t'reely on literary
topics. assuming the mutual interest oi cach in the other’s parauits, but to whom
he is disposed to hold up divine philosophy as a better medicine ol the soul than
either literature or the ambitions oi practical lise.
