THE LITERARY EPISTLES. 331

Odes courcy, would have been turned by this fresh assertion that
poetry was a weakness to which his poverty, not his will, conde-
scended The Epistle then may, with some confidence, be placed
in the two or three years between the publication of Epp. 1 and the
composition of the Carmen Seculare, i.e. between uc. 20 and 17.

Some difficulty remains in fixing a moment during this period
when the condition of Tiberius' absence from Rome is satisfied.
Mommsen (l. c.) finds it in nc. 19 before his return from his pro
gress in the East, which itis assumed took place when Augustus re·
turned in that year. Tbere is, no doubt, some awkwardness in
bringing it so near to the date of Epp. 1. 3, which belongs to the
same expedition, and which seems hardly consistent with what
Horace says, at the beginning of the present Epistle, of his having
wamed Florus before starting that he was no correspondent. There
is hardly time to suppose Florus to have returned to Rome and
started again. At the same time Mommsen seems to show that
Vahlen’s supposition that Tiberius was in Gallia Comata in ac. 18
is unfounded, and that he was not there till 16, which is too late lor
the other condition of this Epistle. In this uncertainty we must
leave the question.

3. Epistula ad Pisones..

The general difficulty of the Ars Poetica, though it has become
proverbial ¹, has been exaggerated, being due in some measure at
least to preconceived opinions with which the poem obstinately re·
fused to be squared: but there is one element of uncertainty about
it on which discussion does not seem to bring us nearer to an agree-
ment Itis the only one of Horace's poems in respect of which a
serious doubt can be said to existas to the periodos his life to
which it is to be assigned3 one school of critics placing it in the
period of the First Book of the Epistles, ie. between uc. 24 and 20,
another making it the worlr of his last years, i.e. between uc. 12
and 8¹.

In the early centuries the question does not seem to have been
raised. No stress can be laid on the place given to the poem in the
