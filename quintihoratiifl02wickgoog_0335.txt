328⁶ GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO

to Florus is the earlier of the two in date of composition. Itis
quite in accordance with the analogy of that Book that room should
be found also for a poem dedicated to private friendship and literary
interests‚ and in which the Emperor has no part. This, however,
although meeting some objections which have been taken to the
later dating of the Ars Poetica, has clearly no weight in positively
determining the question.

1. Epistula ad Augustum.

The account given us in the Suetonian life of Horace (see vol. 1.
p. sorix) of the origin of this Epistle fixes no date, but by its asso-
ciation of the Epistle with the political Odes of Book 4, as vell as
by its assumption of Horace's intimacy with the Emperor, it con-
nects it with the later years of his life. The references to public
events in the opening lines, and in vv. 254-256, are general and
belong to no special year. They relate to Augustus' large and un·
divided responsibility‚ to his military achievements, his social legis·
lation‚ to the closing of the temple of Janus, and to the awe which
he has inspired in the Parthians ¹. Ifa date is to be found in any
particular political allusion it would seem to be in v. 16 ‘iurandas-
que tuum per numen ponimus aras) Ritter fixed on the erection
of an altar at Lyons in ue. 12 (Suet. Claud. 2). The practice, how-
ever, was common in the provinces (Suet. Aug. 59, Dion C. 51. κο).
Mommsen (Hermes, xv. p. ¹03 f), who has examined with care the
date of this Epistle, but pronounces with modesty upon it, prefers to
interpret the verse of the association of the ‘ genius' of the Emperor
with Jupiter and the Dii Penates in the state oath. How early this
can be put is uncertain. The admission of the genius Augusti
among the Lares bya formal act belongs, he says, to ne. 7 (the
year after Horace's death), but Horace speaks of it as popularly re·
cognized in Od 4. 5. 34. Mommsen thinks traces of this quasi·
worship can be found as early as nc. 12, and feels no difficulty in
supposing that Horace is here speaking of it in ue. 13.
