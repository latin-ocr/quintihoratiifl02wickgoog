SATIRE Vl.

COUNTRY LlFE Aur> TOWN LIFE.

Verres r-5. In my Sabine farm 1 hsve got just what 1 longed ἰοῖς and more than
that, 1 have nothing more to ask for.

6-15. My prayers are the acceptable preyers of honesty, soberness, and conteut-
ment.

16-19. Here theu is the frrst theme for my satiric muse, my happy mountain home,
aud the contrast with tlre vexatione and dungers of the city.

20-26. Janus, god of the morning as of all beginnings, let us record a day in
Rome from its beginning. First you summon me in hot haste, iu any weather,
to give surety for a friend.

²7·3¹· When that dangerous business is over 1 have to fight my wny through the
streets. ‘ll'hat are you about,' eries angrr'ly one whom I have jostled, ‘in such
a hurry to keep an engagement again with Maecenas? '

32-39· Ay, there is the sweetening of town life to me, but I cannot even go to
Maeeenas' house in peaoe. As 1 get near it one waylays me to remind me
that Roscius claims my attendance in the Forum to-morrow. Another that the
scribes want me to-day. Another desires Maecenas’ signature and 1 must
get it for him. If I promise to do my best he thinks 1 arn putting him off.

40-49. 'lhat is the way with my friendship for Maecenas. All these (nearly) eight
years it has been misunderstood, the object of remark and of envy.

50-58. 1 am catechired about state secrete, und thought a wonderful man for not
revealing what I do not know.

59-67. So a day is wasted in Rome. What wonder if 1 sigh for the country, for
my books, my siestn, my simple supper:

67-76. amongst friends and homebred slaves, no ceremony, no gossip, but tallr
on things of moment, the nature of happiness, the grounds of friendship‚ the
end of life.

77-111. My neighbour, Cervius, bas always one os his simple stories which just
hita the point. For instance, if any one is raslr enough to speak admiringly
of the wealth of Arellius, he will tell the fable of the town mouse and the
country monse.

The Setire is of great importance in fixing the chronology of Horace's life aud
writings. if it oan be dated itself it fixes (v. 40) tlre date of his admission to
Maecenas’ intimacy, end so gives a startiug-point for dating most of the Satires of
Book 1. Three indications of date seem to be given in the Satire, irr vv. 38 and
55, 56. For their full discussion see Introduction to the Satires, pp. ²·4
