ro THE snrrnes, 15

chosen as prologue and epilogue. (3) For the rest we may trace from
time to time either links oi thought which attraet Satires together or
the desire of variety which seems to keep them apart. Os the first,
instances are Sat r. 2 working out the thought which had come to the
front in 1. 1. 101 s.; 1. 4 giving its iuli significance to 1. 33 perhaps ²·4 -
matching a sally against the Epicureans with 2. 3 which had laughed
at the Stoics. Os the second, the separation os π. 3 from 2. 7, of
2. 2 from 2. 4, and of that again from 2. 8. There is perhaps a sug-
gestion of the irony so often seen in the placing of the Odes in the
collocation of Sat. 2. 7, with its coarse slavehumour and its turning
of his satiric sting upon himself, aster a. 6, in which his tone has
been higher and more didactic than usual: compare the position os
Epp. 1. 15,16, 17.
