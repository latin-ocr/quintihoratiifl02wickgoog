BOOK l OF THE EPISTLES. 209

present in the composition os any particular Epistle. But Horace
meant us, we may be sure, to see this clement in the Epistle itself,
not to depend upon tradition for it.

It must be added that the Epistolary form becomes in some cases
a matter of play-as when he makes a prosessed letter to his bailiff
the vehiele lor the humorous expression os his own love of the
country and dislike oi restlessness (Ep. 14); when he puts an
apology to Augustus into the form os a letter sent after the mes·
senger who is supposed to be carrying to him a volume os poems
(Ep. 13) ; or when he addresses to his own Book of collected
Epistles the confidences and anticipations which he means sor his
world-wide audiencetobe (Ep. ιο).

In calling his Epistles ‘Sermones’ he is expressing the continuity
in substance, and even in form, which unites the most important os
them, those sor the sake os which the book was written, to the
Satires. Their subject is the same, that which always interested
him most deeply,-the art of lis . It runs into the same topics, the
folly of aranee, the wisdom of enjoying instead of wishing, the
charm of country life, of moderate tastes, of contentment. He
fingere amusedly‚ as before, the paradoxes of philosophers, and puts
even more conlidently his view that more is to be learnt from
common sense and from the poets than in the schools. The style
is the same-the iree and unrhetorical style ol the best conversation,
playsul and serious by turns, lighted up by wit, good humour,
touches of poetry. It still cuts an argument short with an anecdote
or a table. There is the same tendency to use an individual name
where a class is meant, and in doing so to mix indiscriminately
names oi the day with literary or even mythological reminis-
cences ¹. The epistolary form is in truth as much a dramatic
adaptation as the form of dialogue adopted in Book 11 of the
Satires. As Acron remarks, it is conversation still, conversation
with the absent instead os conversation held or overheard, with the
present: ‘Epistulis enirn ad absentes loquimur, sermone cum prae·
sentibus ²! In speaking of the Satires we notieed the influence
