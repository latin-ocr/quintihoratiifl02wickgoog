EPISTLE V.

TO TORQUATUS.

Suu introduction to Od. 4. 7.
An invitation to a modest entertainment at the poet's house on the night before
Caesar’s birthday. The tene and topics are very like those of the Odes.

If you do not mind a simple entertainment, Torquatus, 1 shall expect you at
sunset. Iwill get you what wine 1 can: if that is not to your liking, yon must
send better. All is ready andinbest trim in your honour. Leavemoney-makng
and ambition. To-morrow isaholiday, so we can sit all night if we like. The
only use ol fortuneisto enjoy it. Iam in the humour ior merriment. Wine is
nature’s best gift. My business is to see that all is neat and clean, and that the
company is well chosen. 1 shall hare Butra and Septimius and, l hope, Sabinus.
There is room lor you to bring some guests, bnt remember the drawbacks of too
large a party. Your business is to say how many yon wish them to be, and then
to slip away from your business and come.

Nec modica cenare times olus omne patella,

Supremo te sole domi, Torquate, manebo.
