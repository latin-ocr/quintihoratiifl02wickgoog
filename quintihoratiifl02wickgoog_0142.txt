nra. 11. sna. 3. 13⁷

Te quicquam indignum; pudor, inquit, te malus angit,
Insanos qui inter vereare insanus haberi. 40
Primum nam inquiram quid sit furere: hoc si erit in te
Solo, nil verbi, pereas quin fortiter, addam.

Quem mala stultitia et quemcunque inscitia veri

Caecum agit, insanum Chrysippi porticus et grex
Autumat. Haec populos, haec magnos formula reges 45
Excepto sapiente tenet. Nunc accipe, quare

Desipiant omnes aeque ac tu, qui tibi nomen

lnsano posuere. Velut silvis, ubi passim

Palantes error certo de tramite pellit,

llle sinistrorsum, hic dextrorsum abit: unus utrique 50
Error, sed variis illudit partibus ; hoc te

Crede modo insanum, nihilo ut sapientior ille,

Qui te deridet, caudam trahat. Est genus unum
