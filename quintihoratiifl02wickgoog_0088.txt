LIB. I. SAT. 6.

Esse in amicorum numero. Magnum hoc ego duco
Quod placui tibi, qui turpi secernis honestum,

Non patre praeclaro, scd vita et pectore puro.
Atqui si vitiis mediocribus ac mea paucis

Mendosa est natura alioqui recta, velut si

Egregio inspersos reprehendas corpore naevos;

Si neque avaritiam neque sordes nec mala lustra
Obiciet vere quisquam mihi, purus et insons

(Ut me collaudem) si et vivo carus amicis;

Causa fuit pater his, qui macro pauper agello
Noluit in Flavi ludum me mittere, magni

Quo pueri magnis e centurionibus orti,
